Call to Action:
"speaking of new audiences did you know there's a way to gain 1,000 Subs super fast no really well there is check this video out to see what I'm talking about"
This is a typical YouTube end-screen call to action where the creator:

Creates curiosity with a question ("did you know there's a way to gain 1,000 Subs super fast")
Adds emphasis ("no really well there is")
Directs viewers to another video ("check this video out to see what I'm talking about")

The creator is using this to drive traffic to another video in their channel about rapidly gaining subscribers.
