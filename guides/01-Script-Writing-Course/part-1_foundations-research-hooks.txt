# YouTube Script Writing Course - Part 1: Foundations, Research & Hooks

## Introduction

I don't know a whole lot about YouTube I'm not that good at coming of ideas my thumbnails are okay but if there's one thing that I'm good at it's how to write a great YouTube script and that's exactly what we're going to be talking about today in the last 9 months I've written YouTube scripts for 40 plus educational channels and helped them gain millions of views and generate millions of dollars in revenue for their business I've worked with channels like instantly AI hype Fury and Davey Fogerty and other channels with millions of subscribers and my clients pay me thousands of dollars to write scripts for them in this video I'm going to review every thing that you need to know about how to write a killer YouTube script that will get you millions of views but before I get into the content I have some bad news this video is going to be over an hour long so if you don't have the attention span to watch this video for 5 minutes and take notes sorry to tell you but you're probably not going to make it.

We're going to be talking about why you should script a video in the first place how to come up with video ideas my five-step system to creating viral scripts how to write a hook how to write the body section how to write a high converting call to action and breakdowns of my best personal brand videos and documentary scripts and that way you can see my thought process writing scripts from start to finish and you can replicate my exact process by the end of this video my promise to you is that you will have everything that you need to write a script from start to finish in half the time and have your video perform better let's get into it.

## Why Script in the First Place?

So a little bit more about myself right these are some of the best performing videos that I've scripted one of the channels that I script for is instantly AI they're the biggest Cod Emil software company and we grew their channel from 5,000 subscribers to 16,000 subscribers in 5 months they were barely getting any views when they first started and with our videos they've added thousands of news new users to their coding software and you know that's usually well over six figures in revenue generated some of the videos that we scripted 130,000 views in 7 months might not sound like a lot but in the Cod mail Niche where there's actually a very small number of people who consume the Cod mail videos this video alone generated six figures in revenues um on its way to another 100,000 views.

So the big question is why even script in the first place so to understand why we want a script in the first place we have to first understand what makes a video go viral is it looking at the average view duration AV is it looking at the click trate of the video or is it looking at the retention right or is it you know some combination of all of these so while all of these are important metrics to look at there is ultimately one metric that YouTube looks at to decide whether they should push your video to a wider audience and that answer is viewer satisfaction right so satisfaction go up your videos get viewed more what viewer satisfaction actually means is how much people actually enjoy your video so if people enjoy your video YouTube will push your video more view satisfaction is measured by whether people leave your video feeling good meaning whether they are entertained or they've learned something new or it was an emotional experience you need to have you know one element of these or all three of these combined.

And the way YouTube really measures this is like you know what's the view the like ratio what's the number of POS comments how long do people watch the video for do they share it with their friends do they download it to rewatch and really when you script your video you can make a better video that is number one more informational number two more entertaining number three will change the day of your viewer so really one of the big reasons to write a script is so that you can maximize your viewer satisfaction and if your viewer satisfaction of your videos is higher your videos will just perform better so you want the content to actually be better more informational so people will consume it so that's reason number one.

What's reason number two Alex oszi you know one of the biggest entrepreneurs right now one of the biggest youtube personal brands in the business space said this in one of his recent videos he's been going from doing post- production to pre-research so that means instead of doing four weeks of editing he's now doing four weeks of research for his videos and he also said this for educational videos an ounce of pre-work is worth a pound of post this is also probably true for entertainment type videos so what this actually means is that the more effort that you do in the pre-work in the research stage in the scripting stage it is much more in the post prodouction because you don't actually have to spend as much time you don't have to spend as much money on the post- production really if you want to get ahead of your competition I would listen to those ahead of you so people like oroszi a big reason that you want a script is really the time savings and the focus savings.

## Research Framework

Most people hate it, most people suck at it, and most people spend way too much time on it. Really, on my very first video that I posted on this YouTube channel, I spent 20 plus hours on the research, and then I edited for my second draft, and then I did even more research because I really wanted to have the perfect script, but I made a lot of mistakes along the way.

Right now, I've refined the process. Now, I'm going to teach you everything that you need to know about research so you'll know how to research the right way in less time. I'm going to teach you my full research framework that allows me to write viral bangers over and over again.

Research is made up of these four parts:

1. **Audience Understanding** - Know what they need, want and care about
2. **Competitor Analysis** - Spotting trends, gaps and winning strategies in your niche  
3. **Gathering Content** - Collect facts, examples and unique insights that add value
4. **Validation** - Double check any information for accuracy and relevance

### Finding the Perfect Video Length

The wrong length can lose viewers. Too short equals you're missing details. Too long equals viewers click away. Both of which you don't want to happen.

How to find the perfect video length you want to align the length with your video format:
- **Short (2-5 minutes)**: Quick tips or skits
- **Medium (6-12 minutes)**: Tutorials, reviews, how-tos
- **Long (15+ minutes)**: Deep dives, case studies, detailed instruction

The longer the video the more info and value you need to add. Just because you have a longer video length doesn't mean that you can have fluff and doesn't mean that you can add useless information that's not useful to the viewer. We want to make sure that every single piece of information that you give the viewer is useful, is actionable, and can actually add value to them.

### Finding and Talking About the Right Points

Several natural approaches can help relieve headaches, including staying well-hydrated, applying a cold compress to your forehead or temples, getting some rest in a quiet, dark room, and trying gentle neck stretches or massage. When you're looking for potential payoffs and potential points that you want to talk about in your video, you want to avoid covering too much because when you talk about too many points, say in a 10-minute video, you talk about eight different points, that leads to a lack of depth.

To pick the right payoffs in your video, you need to ask yourself this question: **What is lacking from other videos out there?**

What I do when I do my research is you want to look at existing videos out there. You want to find content gaps, and you want to script your video to build on those points. You don't just watch existing videos and copy paste what everyone else is talking about. You want to look at their videos, create a thesis for what the content gap is, what people aren't talking about, and then you script those videos and build on those points.

### Grading System for Videos

I've created a grading system to help us find the best videos to study. Just watch your target videos once and grade them:

- **Insight**: How original and actionable is the information?
- **Hook**: How well does the hook grab attention?
- **Pacing**: Is the video engaging or dragging?
- **Tonality**: Does the tone match the content and audience?
- **Storytelling**: Are the narratives clear and compelling?
- **Editing**: Are the visuals and audio seamless and professional?

Grade each category as:
- **Basic**: Repeats common knowledge, lacks depth, no unique perspective
- **Competent**: Shares helpful tips, ideas are solid but not groundbreaking  
- **Exceptional**: Unique actionable insights that surprise or challenge expectations

## Hook Writing

Hundreds of YouTube script writers send me their scripts asking me to review them every single month. There's one common problem that I see in their scripts: their hooks suck. The hook is the very first line to reel the viewer in. You have less than 30 seconds before the viewer decides to watch the rest of the video or continue watching till the end.

Average attention span shrunk from 12 seconds in the year 2000 to just 8 seconds a day, which is less than a literal goldfish. The job of the hook is to do two things:
1. Validate the click on the video
2. Create intrigue so they want to watch the rest of the video

If you nail the hook, your retention in the first 30 seconds will be upwards of 40 to 50%.

### Elements of an Effective Hook

The hook needs to be:
1. **Clear** - Avoid jargon, be specific
2. **Engaging** - Address the viewer directly
3. **Simple** - Use everyday language

### Common Hook Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake #1: Excessive Jargon**
Example of bad jargon: "The only thing separating you from success as a coach is a killer strategy. I'm about to teach you one that can optimize your client acquisition funnel, scale your MR to $100,000 in 30 days..."

Fixed version: "The only thing separating you from success as a coach is a killer strategy. I'm about to teach you one that can make you 100k in 30 days..."

**Mistake #2: Over-explaining** 
Example: "I made 7,400 barber videos to crack going viral. I spent countless hours researching, testing, editing, and analyzing trends, hashtag, engagement metrics just to figure out what works..."

Fixed: "I made 7,400 barber videos to crack going viral. If you follow these tips, you could go from having nobody watching your content to having thousands and millions of views and followers."

**Mistake #3: Too Many Credentials**
Don't spend a whole paragraph listing credentials. One relevant line is enough to establish authority.

### 10 Types of Hooks

1. **Question Hook**: "Have you ever wondered what would happen to your business if you sent a million emails?"
2. **Shocking Statement**: "You've been working out wrong this whole time"  
3. **Storytelling Hook**: "I went from negative $150,000 in debt to over $5 million in just three years"
4. **Preview Hook**: "Watch me turn $100 to $10,000 trading stocks in 24 hours"
5. **Personal Connection**: "In my college days I suffered from anxiety"
6. **Statistic/Fact Hook**: "90% of businesses shut down after the first three years"
7. **Challenge Hook**: "I scaled four e-commerce sites to six to multi-8 figures in the past 3 years"
8. **Quotation Hook**: "Alex Hormozi said that if you would start over again he'd start a service based business"
9. **Metaphor Hook**: "You are a hunter and..."
10. **Proof Hook**: "I've generated $10 million for my clients combined using cold email"

### How to Write a Hook

When I look at a title, every time when I script a video, I need to have the title before I write the script because title/thumbnail sets expectations for the video and then the hook will follow up from the title and thumbnail.

Whenever I have a title, the title will raise certain questions in the viewer's mind and I just want to outline these questions and I just want to answer them. That's literally it. 

For example, if the title is "Alex Hormozi's $100 Million Cold Email Strategy":
- How did Alex's cold email strategy make him $100 million?
- Is this cold email strategy effective? 
- Is it easy to implement this strategy?
- Can I use it to make money for my business?

Then all I have to do is answer them in the hook. It's like handling objections before a sales call.

### Four Components of a Strong Hook

1. **Confirm viewer expectations** - Validate the click
2. **Introduce curiosity** - Tease a story, solution, or result
3. **Set the stakes** - Highlight why they need to watch
4. **Establish uniqueness** - Show why your content stands out

That's everything you need to know about writing hooks. The key is to avoid the common mistakes, use clear simple language, and answer the questions that naturally arise from your title and thumbnail.
