I don't know a whole lot about YouTube I'm not that good at coming of ideas my thumbnails are okay but if there's one thing that I'm good at it's how to write a great YouTube script and that's exactly what we're going to be talking about today in the last 9 months I've written YouTube scripts for 40 plus educational channels and helped them gain millions of views and generate millions of dollars in revenue for their business I've worked with channels like instantly AI hype Fury and Davey Fogerty and other channels with millions of subscribers and my clients pay me thousands of dollars to write scripts for them in this video I'm going to review every thing that you need to know about how to write a killer YouTube script that will get you millions of views but before I get into the content I have some bad news this video is going to be over an hour long so if you don't have the attention span to watch this video for 5 minutes and take notes sorry to tell you but you're probably not going to make it we're going to be talking about why you should script a video in the first place how to come up with video ideas my five-step system to creating viral scripts how to write a hook how to write the body section how to write a high converting call to action and breakdowns of my best personal brand videos and documentary scripts and that way you can see my thought process writing scripts from

start to finish and you can replicate my exact process by the end of this video my promise to you is that you will have everything that you need to write a script from start to finish in half the time and have your video perform better let's get into it so a little bit more about myself right these are some of the best performing videos that I've scripted one of the channels that I script for is instantly AI they're the biggest Cod Emil software company and we grew their channel from 5,000 subscribers to 16,000 subscribers in 5 months they were barely getting any views when they first started and with our videos they've added thousands of news new users to their coding software and you know that's usually well over six figures in revenue generated some of the videos that we scripted 130,000 views in 7 months might not sound like a lot but in the Cod mail Niche where there's actually a very small number of people who consume the Cod mail videos this video alone generated six figures in revenues um on its way to another 100,000 views all this video you know 26,000 views in 3 months also you know very small niche in COD so it's pretty good 19,000 views in one month or another of our clients Brook hitting right he sells High ticket Drop Shipping consult thing so he's also in the education space you know we scaled his YouTube channel from doing 2K a month to

now over 50k a month and his channels at over you know 75,000 subscribers right now this video get 69,000 views in 4 months which is you know really remarkable considering you know the number of sales that he get from a video like this this video 177,000 views in 3 months this other video 34,000 views in 2 months and then there's me so I started my own channel so that I've skinn in the game so that you know I actually scri my own videos so I know what I'm talking about and I've grown a channel to 1,000 Subs in 23 days days from just three videos and from these videos alone we got 30 calls booked in 23 days for my script writing service so this very first video 10K views and 500 Subs in 2 weeks on a completely new account so you can you can check this out on my Channel all this video which also did pretty well 11,000 views in 5 days with 10 booked calls so these are like sales calls for people wanting to work with me on script writing all this is another Channel that I worked on right gambling documentary Channel tilt 223 uh we scripted their very first video which got over 277,000 views and it's their second best performer today dat so the video is the man who cheated Vegas and almost got away so you can check all these videos out so the big question is why even script in the first place so to understand why we want a

script in the first place we have to first understand what makes a video go viral is it looking at the average view duration AV is it looking at the click trate of the video or is it looking at the retention right or is it you know some combination of all of these so while all of these are important metrics to look at there is ultimately one metric that YouTube looks at to decide whether they should push your video to a wider audience and that answer is viewer satisfaction right so satisfaction go up your videos get viewed more what viewer satisfaction actually means is how much people actually enjoy your video so if people enjoy your video YouTube will push your video more view satisfaction is measured by whether people leave your video feeling good meaning whether they are entertained or they've learned something new or it was an emotional experience you need to have you know one element of these or all three of these combined and and the way YouTube really measures this is like you know what's the view the like ratio what's the number of POS comments how long do people watch the video for do they share it with their friends do they download it to rewatch and really when you script your video you can make a better video that is number one more informational number two more entertaining number

three will change the day of your viewer so really one of the big reasons to write a script is so that you can maximize your viewer satisfaction and if your viewer satisfaction of your videos is higher your videos will just perform better so you want the content to actually be better more informational so people will consume it so that's reason number one what's reason number two Alex oszi you know one of the biggest entrepreneurs right now one of the biggest youtube personal brands in the business space said this in one of his recent videos he's been going from doing post- production to pre-research so that means instead of doing four weeks of editing he's now doing four weeks of research for his videos and he also said this for educational videos an ounce of pre-work is worth a pound of post this is also probably true for entertainment type videos so what this actually means is that the more effort that you do in the pre-work in the research stage in the scripting stage it is much more in the post prodouction because you don't actually have to spend as much time you don't have to spend as much money on the post- production really if you want to get ahead of your competition I would listen to those ahead of you so people like oroszi a big reason that you want a script is really the time savings and the focus savings so one of my clients

you know I just put a large text block here but he said that because I saved him the time of writing the script he had the bandwidth to close $40,000 in sales right all he has to do is get on camera and and just recall himself really one of the big reasons to write a script even though it takes the most amount of time is to save time because it saves time in your postproduction it saves time when you are recording I need to write a script so the video performs better and I save time but this guy doesn't script so this is Charlie Morgan he's one of the bigger business faces right now he said I figured out how to actually get rich 447k views this video technically has no script he was just using his phone and whatnot or this video right the raw reality of making 500k per month no script what gies but really there is something that you are completely missing right those videos are actually scripted they don't look scripted but they are actually scripted to some degree right right so they might come off super authentic but when you watch those specific videos the words that come out of their mouth have a lot of thought put into it almost like they've been thinking about these concepts for their whole lives right so combined with the copyrighting experience it makes it easy for them to go completely quotequote raw and still get views and so I guarantee these guys

would have at least written what they want to talk about in bullets before they started filming but really those videos performing well in the authentic style actually brings up a benefit of scripted videos a good script can take a barely edited video far because if you have a good script the content will be good and the writing will be good and if the writing is good and the content is good people will just want to watch because of the information that you have to say why would you not write a script for your videos the answer is you shouldn't right that's why you're watching this video in the very first place to even understand why we should script we have to understand what the definition of scripting is and the definition of scripting is this it's to write the words of a film play broadcast or speech but in the context of YouTube scripting really just means planning right so scripting a YouTube video doesn't necessarily mean writing out every single word right even though it could be that but it simply just means planning more so it's planning what you want to say in the hook planning the direction of the video planning the outro right scripting is the work that you do before getting on camera a Google Docs is a script if you write a full Google dog and you just talk over it I would consider that a script A Hardo slid is a script right so something like

what I'm presenting right now this is from horoi right flowcharts and drawings are considered a script so this is just on the board some drawings even bullet points are considered a script right so this is a script that I wrote just a couple bullet points and only by scripting your videos can you actually make them more actionable effess to consume it shows your personality have a few good Factor be entertaining and humorous give the viewer exactly what they want and cater to a new audience and your existing audience at the same time when you really put the thought into making your video the best video possible and you actually script your video that is when you can achieve something like that where your video it just becomes really really great that brings us to the next question of should you completely write out your scripts right there's kind of the more raw authentic guys who you know probably just write a couple bullets and they just go off the top of their head and then there's also you know people who make full slides who write out the full script word for word and that's exactly what I'm going to answer right now so really there are two ways to write out a script and number one it's bullet points and number two is to completely flesh it out so how do you know which one is for you and I'm going to give you a couple

criteria that you can look at so that you kind of know which one is better for you you want to write bullet points if you're coherent on camera number two your content is less formal and more conversational right then it's find the right bullets number three you have good memory and can remember the key points you want to cover without a full script number four your video is relatively short and doesn't require a complex narrative or structure and number five it's more of a personal brand not a documentary but if you want to ensure that you cover all the necessary information and don't forget any important points then you want to write a full script or you have a tendency to ramble or go off topic when speaking without a script you want to write a full script you're not confident in your ability to speak off the cuff or improvise effectively write a full script right you need to include specific data and quotes right I'd write it all down or you want to practice and refine your delivery before recording means you just reading out the full script multiple times um before you get on camera so that when you get on camera it's a lot easier in my professional opinion right should you write a full script or should you write it at bullets I personally think you know from writing

over 500 scripts in the span of the past 6 months really the best performing scripts are the ones that are fleshed out word for word I personally find that writing a full script will eventually pay off even though it takes more time but it's a lot easier to get on camera it's a lot easier to edit in post and one last thing before we cut to the real sauce just like how you need to be able to taste food before you learn how to cook to actually write a good script we need to know what a good script looks like what makes a good script a good script and I've Bard it down to these four criteria so number one is the language used incredibly simple if the language used is incredibly simple it's great script number two does the script give the audience exactly what they want if you click on the video the script doesn't give the audience what it wants is it really a good script probably not and number three right I I think this is a very underrated metric would you pay $100 for your video would you pay $100 to go and watch your video in the cinema and if you personally wouldn't pay $100 to go watch your own video then your video is probably not good enough and I think it's the most obvious would you watch this video if you wouldn't watch

your own video if you wouldn't watch your own script while you even writing it in the first place I have a checklist for what makes a great script uh so this is what I use internally and my team so over here I attached it on a Google Docs if you want to have access to it so click the link in the description subscribe to your newsletter and I'll send over this checklist to your inbox along with this full presentation by this point we have covered number one why write a script in the first place and number two scripting just means planning more right so whether that's planning in a Google doc PowerPoint presentation or just drawing some graphics so just plan more and number three should you completely write your script number four what makes a good script a good script so now let's talk about how to script a video so the very first step of writing a great script is something that people completely Overlook but it's actually one of the most important parts of writing a great script most people just go straight into writing the script they they'll just write the script and then they'll decide afterwards what they want the title to be which is I think the completely wrong way to go about it you first want to determine what the title of the video is before you even get into scripting the video because really the title will set

that expectations for the video and then you know your script has to meet those expectations it's kind of like going to your girlfriend's parents house without your girlfriend telling you what her parents are like you won't know what the expectations are and it's going to be a total disaster right you won't know how to match that so what that means is that the first step is to start with the idea or the title and to really understand what the different types of ideas the different types of titles are we first have to understand what the four types of videos that you could potentially be scripting number one it is a Viro vsl number two is Story videos number three is ch Challenge videos number four is documentary videos now I know that there are more than just these four types of videos there are top 10 videos compilation videos but if I would really focus in I would focus on just these four because this is quite a good chunk of the number of videos that most of you guys will be scripting so let's get into it so first one is a viral video sales letter a video sales letter is just a video designed to sell a product or service in an engaging storytelling format that gets viewers to buy something so it often aims to go viral by being very sharable so it uses persuasion techniques to make an emotional connection and convince

viewers that they need to buy the product the video is also more value based but we are selling the viewers on a set of beliefs every time so one example would be this video right my video how imaji made $40 million from one YouTube video and the reason why this is kind of like called a video sales s it's because I'm selling the viewers on a set of beliefs through this I showed my understanding of the different copyrighting techniques that Iman possibly used and from there you know if the viewers are interested in how imang actually scripted that video right they watch it and then they'd see me as an expert and then from there they would come and ask me oh how does he actually script it or can you help me script something like this so number one is a viral video sales letter number two is a story video so a story video you know is a narrative driven video that tells a compelling story often focusing on the journey or character Arc of you know somebody right so this could be like a documentary story or just like a personal branding story so really it uses storytelling elements like drama conflict resolution to draw viewers in and invoke emotion and then there's the challenge type videos right so it's a video where the Creator takes on some kind of challenge standun out experiment

so really the core of it is to entertain through the Creator's reactions and commentary while taking on the challenge this is also technically a viral vssl because the challenge videos are also meant to sell to viewers on a set of beliefs in order to buy a product and then this the documentary video right so this could be a non-fictional informational video that documents events people places or ideas from real life and you know typically it aims to educate or convince viewers about a topic personal event so you could use interviews facts statistics presented in a narrative framework and using compelling footage you need to know what type of video You're scripting so that you can write the script in the right way which brings us to the next question of how do you find these video ideas so we've just gone over the four types of videos how can you find these video ideas and the simple answer is that you can use outlier Theory right and I'm going to explain what this is couple examples of outlier Theory so for example Mr Beast saw this thumbnail right trains versus Pits on the left and he did his own version of it right train versus giant pit or Eric right who saw

this thumbnail on the left 441 million views and he did it for his own thumbnail he did his own version what does outliers actually mean outliers are just videos that are performing above average so a great way to come up with video ideas is to really take inspiration from what is already working on YouTube right outlier theory is just one of the ways to come up with ideas and it's the main way that I used to come up with video ideas so rather than coming up with an idea from thin air they could completely flop instead you actually want to look at what's already working on YouTube and you want to model it I've done it too right so this is a video by John Dorman right how to how to create a killer YouTube video right I did my own version over here at the bottom so these are the four main ways to apply outli Theory I'm going to explain how each of these works so number one you can look at videos from small creats that are clear out Liars number two big creators in your Niche number three videos from adjacent niches performing well and number four videos from broad niches performing well for small creators that have outlier videos one example is this guy right this guy tast athetic you know he got 100K views on this specific video right and this was when he was at you know just a couple thousand subscribers so 100K

views is really outstanding and this guy over here right he basically took took a similar title and he add 2024 and then you can also look at big creators in your Niche right so for example this video by Andrew U 1.2 million in 30 days with Drop Shipping this guy the bottom and and along with many other creators took the similar format in the thumbnail so it's like the Shopify dashboard on the left his face on the right and and there's the red line in the center 1.

8 mil Tik Tok Drop Shipping in 30 days so you can take inspiration from Big creators in your Niche with really good outliers or videos from adjacent niches right and what adjacent niches mean is looking at niches that are similar or closely related to each other the example that I have pulled up here is looking at Facebook ads and code email right because Facebook ads is a way for you to get clients code email is also a way for you to get clients right if you're looking in the business Niche and lastly it's looking at videos from broader niches so if you you are in the Instagram growth Niche say you're making videos there you can look at what's working within social media growth right and if you are in social media growth you can look at what's happening in the business Niche because the business Niche encompasses all of you know social media growth and Instagram growth you know in the business Niche there's also a couple more different Pockets so if you're in the Instagram growth Niche you can look at what's working within the broad business Niche and then you can apply it to your own channel for example right looking at Alex Mosi in the business Niche right he had this video how to get so rich you question the meaning of making money to YouTube growth this video is by learn by Leo

right 572k views how to edit so good your viewers get addicted to your videos so it is a similar format but he adapted it to the YouTube growth Niche and his videos perform really well or here's another example from the coding Niche right how to make Fu money with coding to this video right by Daniel bidden how to make Fu money as a teenager right so he applied what's working in the coding Niche to what's working in business so he he just took the similar format and he applied it for himself and got over 223k views in Just 2 months which is outstanding so just to recap these are the four ways to apply outlier Theory number one you want to look at small creators that are videos that are clear out Liars number two look at big creators in your Niche number three videos from adjacent niches performing well and number four videos from broad niches performing well the big question is how do you find these outliers number one my big advice is to be on YouTube a lot if you are scrolling a lot on YouTube actually looking for specific videos uh if you go on incognito tab if you start a new account and you know and you follow a lot of the accounts within your specific Niche you will stumble

upon a lot of these outliers and from there you can take inspiration but if not the other alternative is to use views.com so Mr Beast just released views.com which is a way for you to find outliers you can also do thumbnail search and AB testing uh v.com basically allows you to search certain keywords and find outliers within that specific Niche or you can also use the outlier format cheat sheet so this is mainly for ED ation businesses so once again if you want to have access to this outlier format cheat sheet I'm going to link this presentation in the description so that you can have access to this presentation and then you can go here and you can click on this outlier format cheat sheet and that way you can get inspiration for your first 60 video ideas it's one of the easiest ways in order to get ideas if you are you know within the education Niche so in terms of action items right you can go to YouTube or use vs.com to find ideas and then you can search for these outliers and what I want you to do is I want you to write 100 video ideas and titles based on these outliers not all 100 ideas would be great what you're trying to do is you're trying to find you know the few ideas that really work so from

the 100 ideas you can filter it down to the top 10 ideas and then in the top 10 ideas you can usually use some of those to create a couple videos but in terms of an action item I want you to pick one of them to create your first video if you haven't already created your first video or to create your next video now that we have the idea the next step is to do research for your video and what research really means means is that you want to find what videos have been made about a certain topic and to find out what videos people want to watch right now to really understand what kind of ideas really work you actually have to understand what's happening on YouTube because YouTube is a race right YouTube is a competition everybody is competing for the same amount of attention so really some of my favorite ways to do research on how to execute a certain script is this number one I think scrolling the comment section is underrated right so what I do is I scroll the comment section to figure out what other people are saying so really the comment section is really underrated because it is the only way for an audience to communicate with a video and Creator within YouTube really from the comment section you can figure out what

parts of a video people like what do people have opinions about what kind of content do they want and really this will show you the kind of videos people want to watch there was this video I gave an AI bought $30,000 to trade stocks um so this video was released a year ago 2.4 million views you can see a 66x outli which is pretty outstanding but when I was watching the video I found this comment right which said over here 1340 tra is outside so basically you click here if you want to see the trade results so really what this indicated to me was that the video was probably too long what can you kind of determine from this right you could kind of create a thesis to say that you want to create a shorter more remarkable video to get the same if not better results so instead of making a 20-minute video you could potentially make a 10-minute video or 15-minute video and then from there that's kind of an improvement on the current video idea so that's kind of how you make your own spin on it so really the second way that I like to do research is to find the top creativ in your Niche and sort their videos by most popular and study each video and the reason you want to study each video is because if they have the most subscribers in your Niche they are

probably doing something right when you're watching each video I think you really want to look out for you know what the type of creative format is what emotion do the thumbnail and title bring out what made this specific hook effective what made the storytelling of the video effective why did most viewers watch to the end and I think if you do this for enough channels you'll be able to reverse engineer the success of their videos and apply those same Concepts to your own videos the goal when you're doing this is to find the reasons for their success model it and improve on it and really when you're watching these videos you need to identify why those videos work model the good parts and integrate your own knowledge so that it is even better right emphasis on better because if you want to win on YouTube you need to be better than your competition so another really big question that I get is how do I know when to start research for me there is no one set timeline for research but you can end the research phase once you feel you have the information that you need or you've digested all of the information needed and then you can just go on to write the script so now that we've got all the research that we need for the video that brings us to arguably the most important part of writing the

script and this part can literally be the difference between a 1 million view video and a 10 million view video and that is writing the hook the job of the hook is really to do two things number one validate the click on the video and number two create Intrigue so that they want to watch the rest of the video so the hook is the first 30 seconds right and really you have less than 30 seconds before the viewer decides to watch the rest of the video or continue watching till the end and if you nail the hook your retention in the first 30 seconds can be upwards of 50 60% sometimes I've even seen 70% and if I would describe what the elements of an effective hook are is that number one you want your hook to be clear and number two you want it to be engaging because you want to reel the viewer in to watch the rest of the video so you need to avoid these if you want to have great hook if you want your hook to be number one clear and number two engaging you need to avoid jogging and when I say jogging I mean words like Prospect clients Ras so Ras means return on ads Ben so if you use specific jogg most people won't understand what your hook means so you

need to avoid jogging number two you need to avoid over explaining so that is selling the video too hard and number three is I'd say excessive credentials right right so that's credentials when not necessary it is giving the viewer too much information when it's not necessary or it doesn't add to the video so we really want to be conscious about the kind of viewer that will click on the video and how we can use our language to appeal to them and what that really means is using simple language so when you're writing a hook you want to use language that appeals to a wide audience because if your hook can appeal to a wide audience and you can get many people to watch then your video retention will just be a lot higher in the first 30 seconds right and that means keeping the language used below below a fifth grade reading level so words like as I said Jing right Prospect or ROI ROI means return on investment should be replaced with words like customer words like returns right respectively and that way we can cast the wide net and cater to as large and audience as possible so simple language is King this is something that I reiterate over and over again to people that I help with scriptwriting you want

to keep the language simple you want to simplify a lot of the language and if I were to Define what a hook is is the first first line which is the first 5 seconds and then it's the introduction these are the 10 types of first liners I want you to screenshot this I want you to save this because these are the most important 10 types of first liners that I've seen that are really effective so number one it's the question hook so have you ever wondered what would happen to your business if you sent a million emails number two it's the shocking statement right you've been working out wrong this whole time number three it's the storytelling hook which is I went from negative $150,000 in depth to over $5 million in just three years this is my story so you start of a story number four it's the preview hook right so it's watch me turn $100 to $10,000 trading stocks in 24 hours or you know this could just be a bunch of Clips in the preview number five it's the personal connection so it's starts of a story again in my college days I suffered from anxiety number six a statistic or fact hook so like 90% of businesses shut down after the first three years number seven it's the challenge hook so I scaled four e-commerce STS to six to multi8 figures in the past 3 years to prove it's not

luck number eight it's the quotation hook hook right Alex hosi said that if you would start over again he'd start a service based business so quotations from experts is also a really great hook number nine the metaphor hook so you are a hunter and number 10 the proof hook right I've generated $10 million for my clients combined using Code email so these are really the 10 types of first liners that you can use what I found when I'm writing a hook is that writing the very first line is the most difficult right after you can write the first line the second line usually flows after it and after you write the second line the third line flows after but figuring out the very first line having something on paper is the most difficult so if you do struggle with that I encourage you to screenshot this so that you can have inspiration for your first lines these are usually the types of first liners that I use nothing too crazy let's talk about the introduction next so really the goal of the introduction which is everything after the first line so after the first second the rest of it is the introduction is really to do three things right it is to number one give context to the video number two set the stakes right so oh like what's going to happen if I don't achieve it or number three establish the main payoff of the

video so payoff meaning is like okay what am I going to get from watching the video so really the introduction is the bridge between the hook and the main content of the video and the payoff is what the viewer will get or learn when they watch the video this is an action item okay this is how you write a hook when you're writing the hook I want you to list out what questions the viewer will have when they see the title and thumbnail the introduction needs to answer all of these questions in order to set proper expectations a really specific example would be say for this video right this video got 12 3K views on instantly I showed it above previously it's titled Alex osi's $100 million code email strategy so when you're looking at this video title what questions will pop into the viewers mind right you just list out those questions and then you answer them okay this works for pretty much every single video title that I have seen so what are the questions that people will have right it could be number one how did Alex's Cod Emil strategy make him $100 million number two is this coding Mo strategy effective that's also another question that people could have number three is it easy to implement a strategy number four can I use it to make money for my business these are the four questions

that I've listed out obviously you can list out more questions so like how much time will it take for me to implement this code Emil strategy but you can usually list out you know maybe 10 questions at most but then you want to filter it down to the most important four to five questions there are usually four to five questions that are super burning in the viewer's mind that you have to answer and you know I've kind of filtered it out to these four and then to write the hook you just answer all of them right so first question how did Alex's coding strategy make him $100 million I said Alex Moi uses code orang to generate zillions of leads across his portfolio companies without lifting a finger and today I'm going to be revealing Alex Mo's full Cod Emil strategy this is the exact strategy let's say if this company gym launched during a time so this part in yellow is his Cod strategy effective it's effective because it saved his company gym launch when it seemed like he was about to go bankrupt right can I use it to make money for my business that answer is that right you can use it to make money for your business because he used it to save his company when it was about to go bankrupt so how does Alex OSI do it I spent the last week breaking down Alex moi's Cod Mill strategy so you don't have to I'll boil it down the four

key steps that make his Cod Mill strategy effective right so boiling it down to four key steps you think it's really complicated but it's actually just these four key steps that makes it easy to implement so that's for number three right is it easy to implement strategy so really why this hook works is because number one we answered every single question number two right in the very first line I said Alex MOSI generated zillions of leads right so and zillions of leads is something most people haven't heard of right it's really noteworthy it immediately catches the viewer's attention and the introduction also lays out the payoffs for what the viewer will learn from the rest of the video and it's also easy to consume in four key steps so if you notice in the introduction every single line has to have a purpose if any line doesn't re the viewer in and doesn't add context for the viewer to listen to the next line it should be cut right you have to be very very precise with your language this is the first 30 second it is the difference between a million view video and a 10 million view video it is that important for you to nail your hook so you want to spend a ton of time

writing your hook and if this still sounds complex right I've compiled a hook swipe file so this is all of the hooks that I've written over the past 6 months I've taken the best 30 to 40 hooks that I've written for all of these educational channels and I've put it together in a swipe file and and I'm going to give you guys access to it so if you guys want access to it once again subscribe to the newsletter go to the link in the description subscribe to the newsletter I'm going to send this presentation to your inbox so that way you can have access to all of the resources that I've just mentioned right and I'll send you daily emails on how to write better scripts and how to grow on YouTube okay let's get back to it right now that we have the hook nail down let's get into the meat and potatoes that is how to write the body so for the body this section will determine whether the viewer actually finds a video valuable and to keep the viewer engaged we want to insert sub points into the video and each sub Point could be say you know it could be S of an ID and then create a thumbnail and write script say I'm teaching the viewer how to create a YouTube video right start of the idea create a thumbnail and write the script another big element that I want to mention is an open loop so when you

explain a point completely to a viewer it's like giving your audience a reward and they feel good once they've learned each new step and the job of the script is to present each Next Step as more important than the previous one so that the viewer will stay anticipating each next step and we do this by creating an open loop so if you're still not sure what that is I'll explain that right now so an open Loop just means a transition with building curiosity so instead of directly telling the viewer the next step is how to write a great script I'm going to use an open loop and I'm going to show you what that looks like so when you're writing a body this is a simple all line that you can potentially use right so instead of mentioning the point out right we actually want to mention the point all the way at the end so this is the start of the body right you start with the open loop and then you talk about the point open loop and then Point open loop and point right and specifically I'm going to show you how to fill this out so with the specific points that I mentioned say how to make a great video right what are the points Point number one come up with a great video idea number two you create a title and thumbnail and number three write a great script so you've kind of filled out filled out the points and then right before you mention the point right you want to mention the point only at the

end right because you want to build curiosity towards that the open loop is a transition from the previous point that also builds curiosity right so a couple open Loops that we can use over here that I've scripted out the first step is the one that is by far the most important and yet also the most overlooked good open loop is a transition with curiosity right so listen to this the first step is the one that is by far the most important yet also the most overlooked here's another example but after coming up with ideas there is one thing that YouTubers will completely neglect and leave till the end of the video creation process when in reality it should actually be one of the first things that you do the next open loop right this next step I'm about to share with you is perhaps the most disregarded step of them all and yet is the one that drives the most results so now we have scripted the open loop and Point open loop and Point open loop and point so that's kind of like the skeleton that we have for the full video but now we actually have to get into scripting the actual content so what I like to do is I want to start with bullet points when you're scripting an explanation for each point you start off by writing bullet points so the reason you don't just want

to you know write the F thing initially without writing any bullet points is because it's usually really hard to follow the logic without writing it out in bullets you notice if you just write the full body out it usually comes out you're not very clear but if you start off by writing bullet points you'll kind of give guidance uh to yourself on how to actually string it together assuming you are writing out the full script really when you're starting with bullets you want to use what I call assumptive questions and really what this means really you want to ask yourself what questions would a viewer have for this section so if I were to script point one which is come up with a great video idea the main questions that I want to answer in my script are number one why is a great idea important number two what is Pro Pro that a great idea is important number three did anybody credible say that a great idea is the first step and number four how do I come up with a great idea and if you notice over here we start with why is something important what is the proof and how do I come with idea so so for really any point that I talk about I want to start with why is it important what is it and how do I Implement something like this so let me

show you an example these are the bullets that I write just based on answering these questions right a great idea get you millions of views with only a few more hours of effort compared to filming hundreds of additional hours of medoc content that answers why is a great idea important number two what is proofed that a great idea is important right if you look at Mr BEAST's Channel he uploaded 22 videos in 2023 if he wanted to he could have uploaded one video a week but he decides to put three times more energy into his best video ideas because the idea behind the video is that important point question number three write did anybody credible say that a great video idea is the first step over here I can play a Mr Beast clip saying that the idea is important so there's also not just scripting it out but there's also the audio visual storytelling that I'm thinking of and number four how do I come with a great idea write 100 ideas and narrow down to a handful of ideas which is also the advice that I gave you previously after writing it out in bullets you can write out the full thing right so really at this point we've completed doing a research writing the hook and writing bullet points so now put it all together in a full script right and really when you're putting it all together and you stringing the sentences together one of the things that I'm always thinking about is the level of Storytelling right

this is always something that I get Q&A on what is the level of Storytelling that we need to meet and really Steve Jobs wants it the most powerful person is the Storyteller stories have the power to capture and hold people's attention right they can make complex ideas or dry information more engaging and more memorable because stories evoke emotions right which can help your audience connect with the content on a deeper level really emotional connections can lead to better understanding and retention of information so stories make the content more relevant and meaningful to their lives stories are that great and the most common misconception is that you can't have storytelling in an educational but really in educational videos storytelling can be the more it could be the very reason why people don't want to watch you in the first place and you can actually build a whole Channel off the quality of Storytelling storytelling is that powerful an example channel is my first million so they're more of a podcast that they turn into YouTube videos but people really love listening to them because they manage to turn business content into stories so let's go over a couple of important storytelling structures and

understanding these storytelling structures is actually important for you to actually execute on it so my first storytelling tip is to use the hero's journey so there's this thing called the hero's journey that pretty much every movie every story follows so it starts with a call to Adventure so over here starts with a call to Adventure right and then you go to threshold Guardians and then you find a mentor there's challenges and temptations right there's a death and rebirth there's a transformation there's an atonement and then you kind of like return to your normal life it is just a storytelling structure to keep in mind where you want to go off on a joury right and then you build up tension to a climax and then you resolve the full story and for something more actionable right storytelling tip number two right you want to use the somebody wanted but so then framework and this is one of my favorite Frameworks because it actually follows the rule where you want to write your script like you are talking so what this means specifically is that somebody wanted is followed by the character's motivation but introduces conflict so outlines the events that wasen a problem and then reveiews how the problem is

solved and the reason why I love this storytelling framework so much is because all of Storytelling is basically someone wanting to do something so that's intention and then there being an obstacle and really this tension over here is what makes a story so exciting an example of this is if you summarize Cinderella it's Cinderella is somebody wanted to attend the king's Ball but the stepmother right which is kind of like the obstacle forced her to do chores to keep her from going so her Fair godmother helped her do the chores and get her to the ball and then she met Prince Sharman the next storytelling tip is to start with the end in mind right and the reason I pasted this Ryan Tran video is because he always manages to evoke a really great emotion at the end of each video right there's there's usually a lesson to be learned at the end of his video and you know there are people say oh this is such a mind-blowing video and the reason he's able to evoke this great emotion is because he starts with the end in mind he really thinks about okay what's the emotion that I want to evoke and then he kind of works backwards from that think about what emotion do you want the viewer to feel right and that could be happiness sadness fear dis just anger surprise right and then from there you

can work backwards to what you want the story to be so storytelling tip four you really want to simplify your video down to the essence of your story and if you really understand what the essence of your story is you can build your story from there so what this specifically means is you want to ask yourself what are you really trying to say in as few words as possible right and strip away everything that distracts from that goal and be concise in your story right the simpler the story the better and storytelling tip five is to create contrast because once again as I said it's somebody going on a mission there's intention and then there's some sort of obstacle what is the reason for this guy's intention and that's usually because you know he used to be in state one right which is you know not where he wanted to be and then he wanted to be in another state right so it's really you want to create contrast between okay where he was and where he wants to be and when you create contrast there's like okay he really wants this there is an actual compelling narrative that makes it okay can he actually do this or not and now the next part I want to go over is probably the most overlooked yet I personally believe is to be the main

difference between your channel absolutely blowing up versus you getting no views at all with your scripts and that is how to write an outro so in terms of outros and call to actions right really the call to action is a prompt at the end of the video to get the viewer to take what action you want them to take in general there are three types of call to actions I would say number one it's selling them on watching another video number two selling them on liking and subscribing and number three selling them on your offer a product pitch so let's get it out the way right I don't think you should be using like And subscribe I personally think if the content is valuable enough the viewers will like And subscribe on their own so and this point is more for businesses right you don't really need to pitch your offer unless it's a 40 minute plus long video where you give massive amounts of value to your viewer only then I believe you have permission to pitch something because if you're asking something from them you better have given them something really good and if your video is only 10 to 20 minutes long I don't think there is enough information for you to justify a pitch General I think you should always pitch to another video when you call to action at the end of your video to another really your end screen click rate will

increase right and when viewers go from one video to another on your channel to another on your channel uh it creates kind of like a spider web that will solve all of your prospects problems one at a time right so your viewers will have all of their problems solved they'll watch more of your videos they'll be entertained because you tell them to click on this other video and at the end of the day it also increases the watch time on your channel which will boost it on the algorithm so I think the very first call to action I want to talk about is how do I write a call to action to another video how do I get more people to click on the next video I use a very simple call to action framework hook curiosity and action right this is the call to action framework that I use every single time to get people to click on another video and I think this is pretty Universal if you want to increase your clickr rate and I'm going to explain how to use this you want to start with a hook to get the attention just before the end of the video because just as you're reaching the end of the video the viewers is kind of like okay is there going to be any more value there usually isn't so you want to hook their attention one more time to get them to Puck their ears up okay there is something more important that is to be said over here number two is curiosity

right so curiosity means to create like a knowledge gap which creates demand for what you're about to pitch next so if you're telling them oh hey actually now that I've talked about this you kind of have to know about this too so there's really a gap so therefore if you click on this other video I'll teach this other new thing to you and then action just means the action you want them to take which is basically click on this video so an example called action to another video so then it's exactly how you send 1,000 code emails every single day on autopilot that's like before the hook but the hook will be but there's something that I didn't tell you at the start of the video oh like what is that right what's this thing that that you didn't tell me and then you want to use curiosity which is everything that I just told you is completely useless if you don't know how to use it to make money for your business now I know all of this but I don't know how to make money for my business so there is a knowledge Gap there so the action is click on this video over here if you want to learn how to get clients with code email in 2024 and I'll see you in the next one now the next question that I always get is is it worth the effort so let's run some math to actually prove that writing the call to action right and spending some time on this is

actually worth the effort so the typical end screen clickr rate to another video on the typical channel is about 5% so with my channel and my client's channels right just using this framework for our call to action our end screen element click rate is 15% and that is actually three times more people clicking from one video to another right instead of 5% it's 15% so assuming if you have 1,000 people watching your video till the end 150 of them will click as supposed to only 50 right and if you do this for every video the number of people we get from one video to another will compound so if you have instead of 15% 15% 15% 15% on every single of your videos as opposed to 5% 5% 5% 5% and you post 30 videos that is a lot more people watching One video to another and really this is a 1% Improvement to your call to action that pretty much no one else would do I I personally think it's worth you know to take 5 minutes of your time to script it out just script out your call to action and now we're going to talk about how do you pitch your product or offer so really for more value based videos you'll want to pitch your offer right you'll want to do a call to action to your offer and really this is only

applicable if you're selling something couple mistakes right you don't just want to tell them to go and book a call of your business big no no right number two you want to hook them in and sell them on the idea of working with you and number three you want to create a logical path for them to working with you given the amount of work that they have to put in an example over here so say the video is on how to start signing clients of code Emil that is a full tutorial on how to start signing clients of code email over here we really want to sell them on working with us so no out you can take everything that I've explained in this video and start running your own code Emil campaigns and you'd probably never have to worry about when you'll get your next client ever again but the truth is it is much easier said and done see I so I hook them in one more time it's much easier said and done there is much more to getting clients from Cod email then just this is just what I've talked about so you have to make sure that your code email copy resonates with your Target customer your inbox is managed your leads don't fall through the crack and that you pick the right strategy for your specific business and offer and if at any stage you make a mistake your whole campaign is toast but you can see how I kind of take them to a logical path that's kind of how you want to do a call to action to your pitch right and once again

spending a little bit of effort scripting it out it is worth it because your conversions will increase you actually want to avoid these mistakes in your call to action right number one it's recapping the points right if they need to revisit a point they can rewind to the pot that they miss number two is having multiple call to actions having multiple call to actions also a big no no because a confused viewer doesn't know what to do and number three it's not giving a reason for why they should follow through with the call to action and being lazy of it so the next most important part that really everyone neglects is how to edit your script so why edit your script in the first place really the main reason is that your first draft will never be perfect right in fact from what I've seen the first draft for pretty much every single writer is terrible and that's okay right we're really not looking for perfection in the first draft right editing is probably one of the hardest things that you can possibly do because it takes so much attention requires you to be so critical of your work but as Stephen King says to write is human to edit is divine in general I think every script should go through one to two rounds of editing because we don't want to rush this process because if we do even the edited version will be complete trash so

you really want to take your time to edit your piece of writing right look at every single word make sure every single word is good in terms of principles on how to edit a script number one I would say incubate if you really think about writing a script after you write you know a full 2,000 words let let's say and you just edit it you won't get to see it with a pair of fresh eyes you'll be like oh actually this writing is pretty good this writing is pretty good because you just did it what you actually want to do is you want to let the writing sit you want to go on a walk you want to go take a nap or maybe you just leave it to the next day for you to edit and number two on how to edit a script it's right like you talk so you really want to be reading your script out loud because at the end of the day a YouTube video is just you talking to the camera uh it's like you talking to a friend it kind of wants to be like a conversation so you don't want to say any crazy words so you really want to simplify your language and you want to be able to write like you talk number three my third piece of advice when you're eding a script is to download grammarly so if you don't really know what grammarly is grammarly is basically a spelling checker it's a grammar checker it helps you resolve all of the tiny mistakes so that when you get on recording you're not like okay is this

weird is this weird is this weird and number four I look out for is there logical flow from one point to another so when you read out your script if there is no logical flow from0 one to point 2 to point three from sentence one to sentence two to sentence three your video won't come off appealing right your video script won't actually be good so you want to be editing for all of these four things right you want to let it incubate you want to write like you talk download grammarly to solve all the small grammar errors and then check for if there is a logical flow from one point to another and I think the best way for me to show you how to edit is to edit the script live so we're going to switch to Google Docs and we're going to look at a script that one of my writers wrote so that you kind of know what to do what not to do when you're editing a script so now we're going to be doing some editing live so to give you a little context about this video uh the video title is over here on the top left right the fastest way to ruin your YouTube channel so it is more of like a negative angle where okay like you mentioned the point and then you talk contrary about why they shouldn't do it so it's like saying oh the fastest way to ruin your YouTube channel is to you know not be consistent in the uploads so

okay not being consistent in your uploads then that way the the viewer knows I do need to be consistent in my uploads so like to give even more context this video title I actually give to all of the applicants who apply to my script writing agency and they write a trial script like this so I'm going to review one of these live and show you how I would edit a script like this whenever you know if I would to write something like this or if someone brings me their piece of writing so here it goes right the hook right there's a bunch of ways you can completely ruin your YouTube channel okay so you state the title again right but if you know what not to do you'll know what you can do and grow a successful Channel with hundreds of thousands of subscribers and easily blow up on YouTube so I'm really reading this out loud and it's really kind of difficult to read out loud so this sentence is probably a little too long so the first thing that I will do when editing is not to actually edit itself right I want to make comments first and then I'll edit it after because you know if I'm switching between okay figuring out what is wrong and actually editing it it becomes very confusing after a while so what I want to do is I'm going to put comments on

each part that I want to edit and then afterwards I'll edit it I'll kind of show you how I do the commenting part of it because actually once you put a bunch of comments on what you need to resolve immediately it becomes a lot clearer how you want to change it so really each line I'm going to be very critical about it and I'm going to point out problems with each line right this one I could say probably this is too long hard to pronounce might make it shorter or into two sentences okay so to ruin your channel start by choosing the broadest Niche I'm like not even sure but this is like the best possible point cuz like there's nothing wrong with like picking a br Niche you know so it's like not immediately obvious why is this wrong okay what is wrong with picking a br Niche if this is the point that we're going to make we have to like really substantiate it I don't think this point or like this payoff or this sub point is even that great of a point to pick right so when choosing a niche make it as broad as possible so it's like okay why are you repeating yourself don't box Yourself by niching down put zero thought into the topic okay what topic so it's like not clear right don't box Yourself by quote unquote niching down what does that mean right so so like immediately in the first couple sentences I can already identify very

big mistakes right cuz it's not sure it's not clear what niching down is and when you're saying something especially towards the start of the video you want to be very clear right make videos on a whim right so it's like okay we can probably simplify whatever Springs to mind so like this isn't a complete sentence right and like sometimes there's nothing wrong with not having a incomplete sentence but like this is very clearly an incomplete sentence have no cohesiveness to your channel okay cohesiveness we can probably simplify this is like a very big word have no cohesiveness to your channel so you always keep your audience on their toes so like what does on their toes mean what does that mean are we like scaring audience I'm not sure right appearing scattered with your video topics will reduce the chance of going viral maybe not not really but like also like what does having multiple topics have to do with going broad right so like the link isn't clear and make sure the algorithm never pushes your video uh like I don't really make sure like the like we can't control this right so like you kind of get what this writer is trying to say but he also doesn't make it very clear so like as the editor or like it's the writer you have to make it very Crystal Clear what you're trying to see and really take it like look at the video

from the viewer's point of view which is great because you won't have to deal with ever being successful take advice from nobody right okay so it's like okay where's the transition from here where is the transition okay this also it's like kind of general not necessarily related YouTube so it's not immediately clear what this has to do with YouTube Right pay no attention to successful YouTubers and always assume you know best pay no attention so you mean don't pay attention to successful YouTubers and always assume you know best you know best about what this is weirdly phrase right when I read out loud it's kind of weird uh in fact disregard all advice so it's like okay you're doubling down okay why are we doubling down here right go through life with a fake sense of self-worth even if you've never done anything to warranted so like what does warrant mean can't simplify probably assume every YouTuber is a scammer is this an assumption that people make right if this is an assumption that YouTubers make then maybe this is something valid but I don't think that people who run a YouTube channel think that every YouTuber is a scammer and all costes our a way to steal your money so like why are we suddenly bringing courses like why suddenly talk about courses seems kind of odd to suddenly talk about courses right do you think

YouTube gurus are really dropping the secret sauce anyways what sauce right also like kind of random to bring in also like this wasn't like really the tonality that that we were talking about also like quote unquote YouTube gurus it's like oh he's like trying to attack somebody it's like also not clear why this is cly brought up there's like no really context to it why would they create more competition for themselves here like okay here we have two questions stacked on top of each other so when we usually see questions in the script we can usually turn that into a statement right so like usually when you have a question you know you're like trying to write in a more conversational tone but usually it's a lot more direct if you just turn into sentence so why would they create more competition for themselves it's like they wouldn't want to create more competition for themselves so that's one way you could turn it a sentence so here we have two questions stacked on top of each other how can we turn this into a statement avoid every opportunity learn and improve your content so you never have to take ownership when things go wrong so this is kind of like repeating right packaging okay never study thumbnails or titles okay that's probably fine or like I would probably split this into two cuz these are two different points right split into two points knock up a thumbnail in minutes or even better use

AI so you never have to do the work like these two points are like not necessarily the same also like it's not very clear what the sentiment around AI thumbnails is I know there are some tools that aren't that great there but maybe there are tools out of there do most people use AI it's like kind of odd to say oh just use AI I would say it's not relevant and don't bother to ask yourself if the AI is done a good job just trust it blindly exclamation mark kind of odd still very weirdly phrased if you ask me it just doesn't flow well this way you'll be sure that no one clicks on your videos start listen differently constantly remind yourself that the top creators only clickbait anyway it's like not true also not an assumption that beginner YouTubers have this is also like something odd to say maybe if it was like 2015 then saying this in a video would kind of make sense but like not really do this to PE Superior to peers and yourself so no one really says peer right no one says Pier do this so often that you actually start to believe it and become so obnoxious no one wants to help us support you so it's like here we kind of start with the point of packaging and then how do we end up that like no one likes you it's like oh this is also not relevant to the main subo here so we also really want to

be careful like here we kind of like just ramble a little bit and then we go so out of left field it's not even remotely close to to what we were talking about on off Cher you do get a connect with other creators make sure to point out everything you think they're wrong about even if you're unqualified to do so this also doesn't link to the main point right bonus points if there's someone who can truly help now or in the future in for nonprofessional look I'm not going to go through and edit this whole script but here like just looking at the first three sub points or the first three you know main payoffs you can kind of see every sentence if you are not really careful when you write the script can be kind of off or there is some improvement that you can make to to every part of the script and you know maybe this is a little more of an advanced more extreme example where okay there's like errors in every sentence but like really if you are very attentive and you look very closely at the way that you write and you're being very critical and here in this case I am being very critical because that is kind of the standard that you need to have when you are writing a YouTube script right the script has to be really good There is almost no room for error or at the very least it can be like very minor

errors but you know generally you want your script to be as good as possible and you know that's really looking at each sentence on in each word does this word fit does the sentence fit here right does it fit the structure right is it blowing right here you can very well see that we stray away from titles and thumbnails very quickly right and that could just be because he doesn't know what else to say about titles and thumbnails which is like okay then it probably means that on the research stage you're probably not doing something right right maybe your research stage isn't as complete right and because your research stage isn't as complete that's why you kind of have the problem here of your script being relatively incomplete and you kind of like string away from the main point cuz you're just trying to fill gaps which is pretty terrible and it's not very close to what you want in an ideal script that's kind of like I think the main takeaway is that like number one when you're editing you want to be very ruthless of yourself this could be your own writing right and maybe the writing you know isn't as far off as this but you still want to be very ruthless right does this line fit here is there any way that I can improve the line and you know

really just being able to see what is wrong with these individual sentences you want to think how can I simplify words what words are potentially too complex and you want to make comments on your whole script right so the script goes on for a little long longer I'd imagine pretty much every single sentence would need some sort of editing if we look at this right aim for nonprofessional look okay never prioritize video quality okay convince yourself it's 2024 and authenticity is back also this is kind of random you don't even really mention authenticity is authenticity something really in the back of people's minds right now like that could potentially be the case you know you need to do a little more research and what's more authentic than the grainy pixelated webcam look from 2005 this is also like not accurate right um who has something like this so don't waste your money on fancy cameras studio microphones okay also like it's not necessar all the fancy equipment right right that way you'll never have clear and crisp visuals is this the Big Goal only unclear disord audio that really annoys your audience so like really we can probably cut out so like in general any words that nend with l y or or ad verbs you can probably cut out right and it's less like annoys your audience it's more you know makes your

audience click off right tell yourself that your message is so important unique and interesting that it will Solo Carry the video Solo Carry is like this is more of like a gaming term like most people don't know what this means tell yourself that your message is so important unique and interesting that it will Solo Carry the video sure I'm I'm also like not too sure how to improve on that so I'll kind of leave at that right this way when your audience doesn't tune in you can tell yourself that they're the ones missing out do people really have this mindset I feel like people don't really have that mindset right forget about fancy lighting soundproofing or appearing professional also like here right fancy lighting like you know fancy and lighting like not a good descriptor here we say it's like nonprofessional look like maybe some proofing like also not accurate here when we say like look like it's like how we appear so it's like also not really related to like the main payoff assume natural light is overrated also like where does this kind of come from and your neighbor's dog boing in the background adds to that real life feel do people mention this this really comes down to actually not understanding where your current audience at or like OV exaggerating right and really if you OV exaggerate it it's tough for your

audience to really connect with what you're trying to say never edit your video so you don't appear to care people do edit their videos also like don't appear to care like that's like very loose language I would say caring about your videos only adds pressure to your life and value to your audience leaving every UMR and Technical glitch no one really says technical glitch I kind of understand what he's trying to say but it's like probably wrong word choice and tell yourself your viewers love seeing you go through the same struggles in them kind of odd phrasing this way you'll never have to pay someone or put in effort yourself also like doesn't necessarily link to a nonprofessional look here you know you can see on a line by line basis that there are quite a few problems just by like commenting like this if you do this for your own script and be very critical okay each line there's something wrong then you can change it up right in this case I would probably rewrite the full script if you have you know probably this many mistakes in your script if not like you know if you just have like a couple changes right and and some of these changes like really like relatively simple you can just change it line by line then yeah like go go ahead just just edit it line by line so now what I want to do is break down some of my most popular videos on this channel so that

would be how to make a killer YouTube video for the 20 for algorithm which got 15K views in just a couple days I want to show you how I managed to go viral on a completely fresh Channel with a really good quality script and you know really show you how to apply some of the principles that I've talked about beforehand and really take you through my thought process of how I write these specific scripts how I write the hook how I write the body and the flow of thought when doing that this video managed to get 10,000 plus views in just a couple days on a completely fresh Channel I believe just because of the quality of the script writing okay so over here the title of the video once again is how to make a killer YouTube video for the 2024 algorithm I just kind of wrote the structure here I obviously fleshed out the structure a little bit but the structure would be right we start with the idea title and thumbnail script filming and editing these are like the main sub points within the video that I want to cover and then we have the outro and call to action so like this is like the main uh structure of the video so for the hook one killer YouTube video could completely change your life right so immediately a strong first line right it's a statement it

immediately hooks you right it can completely change your life right that's a very bold claim to make so if I were to use this strong of a hook as a bold claim I need to back it up with reasoning in the second sentence so let's see what the second sentence is right it can give you the momentum to go from zero to 100,000 subscribers in record-breaking time just like many of your favorite creators who became successful on YouTube because of one viral video right and on screen it will pop up all the favorite creators right and here there's clear backing up of the very first sentence right going from zero to 100,000 subscribers in record-breaking time who became successful on YouTube Just because of one viral video I've spent the past 5 months researching the biggest creators on this platform so that is me spending time out of my day and you know the viewer only has to spend you know 10 10 odd minutes to watch my video you know 5 months in exchange for 10 minutes that's pretty good trade right that's the function of this sentence and in this video I'm going to review how to make a YouTube video that will blow up your channel and it all comes down to five simple steps so this last line sets expectations for what the viewer is going to get from the rest of the video

and I'm going to say it's five simple steps so that way it's easily digestible that's the hook I think like a really good takeaway from this Hook is that the first line must be really strong and then if you use a really strong first line you need to back it up uh with the next couple sentences what I kind of want to show here is the body right the very first line is if you would to just mentioned the sub point and be like okay so the first step is to come up with a great idea look at what I do here the first line here is the first step is the one that is by far the most important and yet also the most overlooked right this is the open loop that I mentioned earlier so this open loop it creates a curiosity and then even immediately after that I don't immediately mention what the point is right you see there are two different kinds of YouTubers one of them pushes content every week without fail and try to win by overwhelming the YouTube algorithm with content so I kind of build a scenario here one time set up the camera hit film talk to it for 10 minutes post and on to the next video they get so caught up with the filming and editing process they never leave room to Think Through what they are even putting out they usually end up doing all right getting 200 to 1,000 views so here I'm kind of creating a little bit of contrast right

one scenario where you don't really think of the idea and you get 200,000 views and then there is the other Camp who takes their time to come up with the idea first it's been days weeks even months coming up with something spectacular and they create content around those ideas but when they do decide to upload a video it's a straight up Banger the audience loves it the algorithm loves it and their Channel takes off so you see here this is a storytelling technique of creating contrast so it is one state where it's like okay you don't really perform well because you don't really think of the idea and there's the other Camp who thinks of the idea first so there's a really a contrast here there's a little bit of tension here to show okay this is what it could be if you actually spend a lot of time on the idea if you look at Mr BEAST's channel so here I mentioned evidence right so if you look at Mr BEAST's Channel he uploaded 22 videos in 2023 if he wanted to he could have uploaded one video a week but he decides to put three times more energy into his best video ideas because the idea behind the video is that important he says this himself right here I double down even more right a good idea will get you 1,000 views a great idea will make you Millions you can film edit and make the highest quality video in the world with Marvel CGI baked into it but if no one

wants to click it it likely means your video idea was uninteresting so the first step is to come up with a great video idea you see over here so after over 250 words only then do I mention the first point right which is so the first step is come of a great video idea only here do I reveal it and after I reveal it I need to show how to actually do it right so for me what I do is take out a Google doc and list out a 100 potential video ideas this could come from looking at the best performance within your Niche thinking about what ideas were successful outside of your Niche and how you can apply it to your channel and coming up with unique ideas that have never been posted before from there you'll want to narrow it down to 20 ideas 10 ideas and eventually a handful of ideas you can turn into videos so there you go that's the how of how to do it so if you notice the structure it starts with an open loop and then it's why right this whole section is kind of a why you want to start with a great idea what is it which is the first step that is to come up with great video idea and then over here is the how we go with a why what how and you know we kind of list out all of the questions that the viewer could potentially have about how to come of a great idea and we just answer every

single one of them let's look at the next point so this is the open loop once again right but most YouTube gurus after coming up with ideas there is one thing that YouTubers will completely neglect and leave till the end of the video creation process when in reality it should actually be one of the first things that you do so here this is the open loop right so when you open the YouTube homepage viewers are present presented with dozens of videos to watch and with the addition of YouTube shorts a few years ago there is even less space for your video so here I presented a scario of YouTube homepage with a bunch of videos to watch right so this is on the idea of there being a bunch of competition and now I exaggerate I double down even more right there's even less space on your video because of YouTube shorts so if your video does not stand out from the crowd it will not get clicked so that's why you want to focus on creating your title and thumbnail here I put a scenario right it's like YouTube homepage there's a lot of competition that's why you need the stand out so that's why you need a title and thumbnail and then this is the what you might think me the title and thumbnail aren't that big of a deal but you need to realize that they are kind of like the bait in the mouse trap so over here you can see I'm actually scripting out how I will say it right so I'm directing

myself in terms of okay I'm going to say it this way me the title and thumbnails aren't that big of a deal so not just the script is important it is how you deliver the script so without some tasty cheese to draw the mouse in there's a much lower chance that they just randomly end up in the track and how often does a mouse just trip and fall into a trap without bait let not to say we want to trap our audience but it's a simple way of looking at it here it's kind of dragged out a little bit you know I I would say that this part of the script could be improved so you know when you look back there's always improvements to be made right the more in tasty and irresistible debate the more mice we can catch the more mice we can catch the faster our Channel blows up and you know the rest so makes a great title and thumbnail so we kind of have to elaborate on what's a great title and thumbnail one of the big lessons here is to show not tell and I think I do it pretty good in this section let's compare some old and new YouTube videos from the biggest channels to see what mistakes they made and how they have improved over time so here I have the hor Moi video right this video what I would do if I had gyms only applies to gym owners which is a tiny segment of the population so the chances of people clicking on the video is much lower for a video to blow up you want to

interest the largest number of people compare that with a recent video Alex OSI posted which is this can you see how this title and thumbnail appeals to a wider audience now not all the information May apply to gyms but the guiding business principles are the same across the board so gymm owners will still click on the video so here I am showing what a great thumbnail is right by doing comparison with bad thumbnail versus good thumbnail so you can very clearly see what the differences are and here I bring another example right all this old Cody Sanchez video had is small words in the thumbnail that are hard to read and have a weird red coloring to it so here in the edit we will visually show this versus this packaging which stands out so there is once again contrast right which is one of the big things one of the big storytelling techniques right so versus packaging that stands out when we first see this we see the title with the words millionaire investor and then we look at the thumbnail which says buy a business for 0 and that immediately piques my curiosity not to mention that the colors pop and make me want to click and then there's also this red highlight on the thumbnail now I'm not saying that you should spend 50 hours in Photoshop every time you want to make a thumbnail right so it is a resolving one of the

objections or something that the audience think about that's the purpose of this line you don't just want to design something aesthetically pleasing you want to think about the psychology when it comes to getting a click and that means considering how your thumbnail will work with your title to create interest and Intrigue the best videos may not have the most beautiful thumbnails or may not have the most complicated titles but they should work hand in hand to get the click so here this is all still why you want to have a great thumbnail right all like this is also you know trending towards like the how section here we give another example right look at one of mar robo's oldest videos so here I say you don't need the most beautiful thumbnails and then I kind of want to give an example right that thumbnail was probably taken with his iPhone barely edited and the title is simple but it's nothing like I've seen before and the title makes me think how can I do that at my next party the language use here is like very engaging it's very fast and that's like very in line with like the pacing of the video that I wanted when you're writing your script also I was very conscious about the pacing of the video that I was kind of looking for when I'm designing my title and thumbnail I write out five to 10 variations of the video title and I ask my friends and family which one they would click on so here once again is the

how section right so how do you do it it's 5 to 10 variations the reason why there's such an emphasis on how to actually do it is because when your viewer walks away from the video they need to have learned how to do something right and ideally they would have learned how to apply something new that you would have thought to them and that's the house section right right out five to 10 variations or if you have a social media following you can ask them too right once you have finalized the title get to designing the thumbnail and again you can have a few variations that you can get feedback on once youve set your title and thumbnail you are ready to make the actual content of the video so next scene Tre this next step I'm about to share with you is perhaps the most disregarded step of them all and yet is the one that drives the most results once again another open loop I'd imagine that we started a y here right so in the 2024 algorithm a common misconception is that YouTubers will tell you to optimize for click rate and watch time but the truth is the one metric that YouTube looks at more than anything is viewer satisfaction right if you would have watched the this point I would have mentioned this at the very start and that means where do people engage and thoroughly enjoy your video so to increase viewer satisfaction you have to create remarkable content so once again if you look at the flow from sentence one sentence two to sentence

three it flows very easily there's a very logical flow where it's like okay we start off with the common misconception what do people mostly get wrong and what is it actually meant to be right it's actually meant to be viewer satisfaction and it all comes down to the script writing process so instead of telling you directly okay so the next step is script the script is important because of this is this I'm telling you okay actually most people think it's this but it's actually the view satisfaction that's important the way that you actually optimize it is through the script writing process and then I go on and tell you how to script it right so scripting is by far what I spend the most time on and when done properly it makes your filming and editing process much easier the script will allow you to retain your viewers attention to grow your channel exponentially faster and it will make your videos much more valuable and entertaining it is how Mr Beast is able to plan his large filming sets and the story he wants to tell in each video The Script is the difference between you building a 100,000 subscriber YouTube all staying stuck at 17 views a video and then afterwards I go into the how section of how to write a script so it's like hook body and call Action we've kind of talked about it I don't want to go over that again and basically I repeat the same structure right off you start with open loop you have the why what how and you have examples

uh you do a little bit of contrast and I did it throughout this whole video and it worked right so here I'm I'm not going to go over all of this if you want access to this transcript you can get access to it through this course so I will link it in the course so subscribe to the newsletter and you can get access to this course and you can scroll down towards the bottom few slides and you can get access to this the one thing that I want to talk about is this is the call to action so the call to action kind of starts here oh yeah and the last hidden step that I must mention is to be patient the YouTube game is a process that takes time and effort to get right and not everyone gets it on their first try so don't be discouraged if your first video doesn't get picked up by the algorithm just give it some time so here this is kind of the last point so if you like this video and want to see more in depth breakdowns like this drop a like And subscribe so if you watched the call to action section earlier I would have mentioned that oh don't use like And subscribe right you should always want to pitch another video or pitch to offer but in this case this video was actually the very first video on my channel so because it's the very first video there isn't another video to do a call to action to so you can't do a direct call to action to that and it's my very first on my channel I definitely don't want to be pitching my offer and I can only

pitch my offer if it's like a 40 minute plus video the only last pitch left is drop a like And subscribe so that's what I did and by the way YouTube thinks you should watch this video Let's see if they are right so over here at the end we don't have a specific video to call to action them to because this is the very first video on the channel I'm just saying Okay click on this video right YouTube might recommend you something so whatever is my next video that I do I'll do a callaction to that so that is the breakdown of my very first script another script that I want to break down that I think also has really great value really great lessons to learn from is my imang gaji script how imang gaji made $40 million from one YouTube video so let's look at that right now so on the screen right the video of how imaji made $40 million from one YouTube video it is breaking down his best business models video so I've linked it here breaking down this video and really the goal of this video that I had defined earlier it's number one to go viral and number two book 500 sales calls for my script writing offer and you know what that specifically means is I really want to build Authority I want people to know that I am able to actually the video what we have to address for the audience to see me as an authority in scripting we have to Define these couple things

right which is going to be the main points of the video so number one they have to know what a vssl is so vssl is a video sales letter I would have already described it earlier in the course number two break down the copy in a simple way right it has to be simple for the viewer to understand and also I must be aware that most people don't understand how copyrighting works right most people don't understand the psychology behind it so I have to break that down and also one of the visions that I had for this video is that I wanted to make the pacing of my video similar to how imang gaji did it right so his video is you know narrated at a certain Pace I have to follow that exact pace so I need to integrate the pacing of his video with the pacing of my video so let's look in the hook right the hook starts with listen up because imang gaji made $40 million for one YouTube video and used it to pay for his private jet and I think this first line is immediately very interesting so here right it starts with listen up right and you know you think that okay usually you want to cut out a lot of the fluff when you are you know writing your hook and listen up sounds like something you can possibly cut this is more of like a

branding thing uh because imang gaji in all of his videos kind of start with listen up because imang gaji made $40 million from one YouTube video you just repeat the title here and Ed it to pay for his private jet so here is something very specific right it's because a lot of iman's audience would be clicking on this video or at least people who know imang gaji would click on this video and during the time when this video was being released or when I was going to release this video it was pretty big news around the community that he was getting a private jet or he was going to buy a private jet here I decided to insert that joke and hopefully that resonated audience and and turns out it worked out pretty well and because I want a private jet too I spent three weeks slaving away at my computer to figure out how he did it so all you have to do to become imang gaji is watch this video right and then it's the video plus graph animation so what is the thought process kind of behind this right and because I want a priv jet too so it makes it kind of personal right now I have an investment in one a private jet I want a private jet I spend three weeks slaying away and all you have to do is this so once again it is a good trade of time this is called a input bias right where I put in three weeks of work whereas you just have to put in 10

minutes of time to watch this video this is the video I'm talking about on blur Plus show right so here I'm really thinking about the visual storytelling or how I can potentially visually represent what's on screen the best online business to start as a beginner which sits at over 8 million views so immediately after this part right which sits at over 8 million views what's like the next natural step right let's see what I did right with an almost 40 minute video he could have plays ads every 10 minutes and make tens of thousands of dollars in AdSense so my current audience is you know people who want to grow on YouTube or people who are interested in imang gaji that's the kind of people who will click on this video most people would think that the only way to make money on YouTube is true AdSense right is true ad Revenue that's where a lot of the channels make money from but Iman gaji is a little different he sells a digital product and that's how he makes his money really what I wanted to Target is to show actually you know you don't really need need to you know make money from AdSense or like more like imang gaji didn't make his money from AdSense but actually he did this other way but when I clicked on this video I noticed something no ads which I thought was silly at first why would you give away that much money on the table but this move was actually

genius so it's like saying oh GOI kind of didn't do this but I realized that it was actually genius see most YouTubers make money of AdSense and sponsorships so that's the immediate awareness that I want to Target they sell someone else's product and take a tiny cut of the money generated with it but imang gaji wanted not just a slice of the pie but the cake so here there's kind of like a visual storytelling which is why 8 years ago imang gaji set a plan in motion so here we're kind of like saying oh imaji is kind of on a mission right he set a plan in motion right he's been scheming for a really long time he spent years building up his audience gaining their trust and then made a product which he suddenly sells to his audience for the entire video so here on like the copyrighting level you can kind of see he started something right he spent years building his audience gaining their trust and then he made a product right you see this isn't a normal video this type of video is called a video sales letter which is meant to get you completely convinced to buy a product after watching it so a video sales letter this is jogon that I'm introducing right right and nothing wrong with including Jon but you can only include it if you explain what it means right first of all my audience probably doesn't know what a

video sales letter means so if I mention it and I don't explain it then the viewer is much likely to click off but if you're targeting a very technical audience maybe it's okay to use more technical language right which is meant to get you completely convinced to buy a product after watching it right that is the very base definition that is the easiest way and simple way of explaining what a video sales letter is or what a vssl is here next line right Iman knew there was a problem with the old style of sales when you see a sponsored spot or sleazy sales guy you skip right it's because you don't like being sold but by the end of iman's video you are thanking him for selling you his product so I'm going as far to praise him for being a savior right so it's like here once again what am I doing I'm creating contast right previously sponsor spot sleazy sales guy nobody likes that but when he did this everyone's calling him a savior right everyone's saying that oh iman's the best right thank you for selling me the product which is an ideal outcome that people want to have so after spending hours breaking down his video looking at every individual word he used turns out he found a solution and then it's like okay like what's the solution and it all starts with phase one brainwashed so here you know I could have very easily just gone into talking about the script immediately but what I

realized is that there was a lot of needed context for the viewer to know what imang gaji was actually trying to do with the video so I to make it very clear what the goal of iman's video was and really give the viewer enough context so here after the hook you can see how much context I that I give it's about 250 words worth of context which is about you know one to two minutes of context that I give to the viewer so that the viewer has the frame to understand what I'm trying to say in this video right and only then do I actually go into the main piece of content and it all starts with phase one brain and it'll be Fade Into His video right so look we're entering a new era so like this is his video and I link the video for my Editor to edit right so look we're entering new error everything's changing and then there's like the pause effect is what I imagine step one establish premise and then you play and I press play again and then we go on to the next part this is his video so we're entering what experts are calling the new Arbitrage economy and these are a bunch of 20-year-olds taking advantage of it to get paid as much as a doctor every month without having any previous work experience and then I link the video again and then I pause it again step two induce fear and open a

cliff between what the viewer knows and what they still want to know so if the words here are kind of complicated it's because that is intentional right but you said Brian why don't you write simply here but really what I'm trying to do here is create an open loop so induce fear and open a cliff between what the viewer knows and what they want to know and then I go back to this video right more about that in just a minute see what he did there and then that's kind of my line again right see what he did there this intro is genius right here I emphasize it genius cuz I'm going to say it that way with 10 words he grabs your attention and then you play his graphic another 10 you're afraid you play his graphic another 10 and you're hopeful and then he takes you on a roller coaster he swiftly takes out your critical thinking and now you're curious emotional inspired all at the same time which lines him up perfectly for phase two so here I kind of explained right with all of these words he's saying he actually brings out the emotion in us right he takes out your critical thinking and he makes you feel curious emotional inspired all at the same time so I immediately attribute a function to his hook right it's to get you to

disengage your critical thinking and in phase two I give it a good headline again heighten expectation and don't close the loop so once again this function as like an open loop but it is a visual open loop cuz I have this on screen right very clearly there is a curiosity Gap like how does he heighten expectations and then here I play his clip again right and then I do the same pause effect so this is his clip and it plays the same pause effect step three handle objections answer every possible question that his viewer might have before they even get to say it and then there's like another clip here step four and then I pause again right so it's the same effect so it is play clip pause commentary play clip commentry play clip commentary right what is another way that you know it could be very easy to script this right it could be a large chunk of the video and then I commented on it this is really a more advanced way of doing the reaction type content so when I was writing the script I had to you know cut out Clips you know I had to watch his video multiple times to figure out okay what chunks do I want to include in my video to show you know really what Iman is doing and what are the main crucial parts of his video sales letter that will be interesting to break down and back to this right step

four identify the viewer he uses social proof that shows the transformation from his of his ideal customers current state to the dream state right giving evidence that if they learn about what this business model is or figure out what the new Arbitrage economy is they can make that sweet 10K month so here I'm explaining basically what he does with the case study and it goes back to his video right pause again step five Savage the payoff in the first 1 minute 50 seconds he has convinced a completely cold viewer to watch the rest of the video which is exactly the job of the hook here is kind of like a conclusion of the hook right what does he managed to do with the hook which brings us to face treat right breaking beliefs here's a voice over right imang gaji understood this one thing which allowed him to sell tens of Millions with a single video before trying to get someone to take action like purchasing something you need to align your beliefs with theirs otherwise it's kind of like telling a Christian guy to do some Buddhist prayer it wouldn't make sense here I tried inerting a joke maybe it kind of like fell flat a little bit but here I kind of like gave a little bit of context on like what beliefs are so once again I I introduced Jon right which is breaking beliefs so here I have to show something that's a little relatable here I also

draw another analogy right just in case it wasn't clear in the very first place so let's say A salesperson is selling me a vacuum cleaner I have to understand what technology the vacuum cleaner uses why this vacuum cleaner is better than every other vacuum cleaner out there have proof that the vacuum cleaner works now Iman is not selling a Dyson V1 but the same Concepts still apply in this case for me to buy his course on how to start an smma there are certain facts that have to click in my head the audience will be rather aware of him selling a course so they'll be familiar with what smma means if you know imang gaji you know what SM means me so here is okay to use Jon and not explain it so that's really understanding where your current where the person who clicks on this video is at like audience awareness wise why does this business model work so well why other business models don't work and smma is the best one and prove that smma works so I would need to make this clear to the viewer and then instead of just oh he did this by talking about this I take this opportunity to show right if I can show it with a clip I will show it of a clip and I don't have to say it right look at how he does it right three reasons why this m model works so I flash clip one flash clip two and Flash clip tree so here what I imagine is not just like you

know the clip playing on screen here obviously I have to give the editor notes and and I kind of made comments on how I I'd imagine the edit to be oh it will play the clip and then he he would draw arrows play another clip draw Arrow play another clip draw an arrow to really visually show how he's doing each one of these over here and then here we go to phase four I kind of did something similar you know with a little bit of variation in terms of the structure but pretty much you know phase one to phase five is pretty similar it's switching between clips and really using the clips to show instead of telling right you really want to demonstrate how to actually do it you can go ahead and read the rest of this script once again you can get in the newsletter you can get full calls you can get access to these transcripts but the main part that I want to look at right now is the call so it starts here but it worked he converted all the attention he had captured in phases 1 to four and delivered the perfect right hook with a pitch here before over here I talk about how he does a call to action right and how he gets people to pitch and and the pitch being like 30 minutes long so It Starts Here Right which is a testament that you should never overlook your call to action in your YouTube videos so that is how imang gaji make millions with his

famous best business models video with just a PowerPoint slide and his voice so once again I wrap up the whole video but I double down okay the video did so well even though it's just a PowerPoint slide and his voice no fancy edits no dramatic music if that isn't Testament to the power of a good script I don't know what is right so it is once again reminding them actually the script is what really carried this right it's no crazy edits no dramatic music it's actually just the script that really drove a lot of conversions and allowed him to make $40 million that's really the power of a good script and speaking of a good script so I do a little callback right speaking of a good script click on this video over here to learn how to script a viral YouTube video just like IMM so once again I'm doing a callback to what Iman did and then here I use that as part of the call to action so here there's really like the knowledge Gap here it's really a modified version of the hook curiosity action right but like really the hook here you could just say it's like the no fancy it's no dramatic music where it's like oh wow that's actually like really impressive and then the knowledge Gap is Testament to p a good script here maybe I could have said oh if you want to make $40 million just like Iman you need to know how to write

a really good script you know or that could be a little too repetitive I think this was a really good script right this is a really good call to action this this call to action ended up getting like a 15 like 15.9% I I think I showed you guys the screenshot a little earlier but at least a 15% end screen element click rate which is one of the better call actions over here I'm not too upset about that and if I would say what are the main takeaways really from this imong gaji video I would say number one show not tell you want to be showing and the way that I did the showing was true the clipse right you want to show and not tell as much as possible right it is very easy to go into default mode and just tell your audience but what is a way that you know you can create a little bit of contrast and show and do a little of audio visual storytelling to get the viewer invested in the story that you're trying to tell in the narrative that you're trying to push so over here is the scripting framework that I use to write all of my scripts and all of my CLI scripts and here you'll kind of see some similarities here over here we won't have the title at the very start so before we even write a script we have the title just so that we can set expectations and then we can meet them in the hook and in the body so some guiding questions over here what other the questions that can come

from the title right so as I mentioned earlier with the title there'll be a couple questions that come and with those questions right you just list out all those questions and then you answer each of them in the hook that's how you write a really effective hook on top of you know the hook being clear and engaging and then couple secondary questions right who is your avatar who are you targeting to remind you okay how can I tailor my language to this specific Avatar what objections might they have when they see the title what transformation will they have in the end what's at stake what are the benefits of their dream outcome so all of these are good guiding questions to help you ride your hook and pretty much once you answer all of them your language can be more tailored for your hook and then for the body section here it's kind of like it's pretty rough where it's like okay here we start with open loop and then we have to pay off and then within the body the question that we want to answer is okay why is this important what is it and how so so we always do the why what how framework or at the very least these three questions need to be answered right and obviously Within These right I'll be like okay what examples can I bring in what are certain evidence what are stories that I can tell based on this and you can even build on these questions once again right to write the body you write the payoff over here and

then you write open loop and then you write the questions and then you can just answer these questions right why what how is just kind of like a guiding question base of like okay why something what something how something and over here similarly right open loop why what how payoff here open loop why what how pay off and over here you have the call to action right which is make a point that links into the current video widen the Curiosity Gap and promise a specific transformation they experience by clicking the next video right so this is the hook curiosity action framework right so make a point hook widen the Curiosity gap which is the Curiosity and then what action do they want to take and here you can write it out and then over here I have a note at the end did I run this script true grammarly right so that way you can make sure that there are no grammar errors thank you for watching this video now all that's left for you to do is to write your next script apply these Frameworks and actually go viral so if you want access to this presentation the out live format descripting Frameworks and my video transcripts I highly encourage you to subscribe to my newsletter the link will be in the description and you know I'll send you this presentation directly to your inbox and if you want to watch the imang gaji video that I hyped up so much

This is the only guide that you'll need to master YouTube script writing. A year ago, I uploaded a full YouTube script writing course that got over 200,000 views. And since then, I've worked with the top educational YouTubers and have generated millions of views along with millions of dollars with my scripts.

 And now, I want to give you all the newfound knowledge that I've acquired since then. I've literally spent hundreds of hours putting together a,000 plus slides just for this one video. We have full script breakdowns, live script editing, step-by-step walkthroughs, literally everything that you need to know to go from a beginner to an expert at YouTube script writing will be covered in this video.

 But wait, before we get into this video, there's something I have to tell you. If you can sit down for more than 5 minutes and take notes to even get 1% better at YouTube script writing, sorry to tell you, but you're probably not going to make it. We're going to cover number one, how to research videos so you can outclass your competitors.

Number two, my exact hookw writing frameworks to capture your audience's attention in the first 30 seconds of the video. Number three, how to script your video payoffs. Number four, how to write an open loop so that you can transition from one section to another without losing retention.

 Number five, how to write call to actions in the middle and at the end of your video so that it actually converts viewers into customers. Number six, how to edit your script. And we also have a live breakdown of me editing scripts live. Number seven, how to storyboard your video. And number eight, how you can use my full YouTube script writing system and feed it into an AI to help you write better YouTube scripts.

 So now let's get into research. Most people hate it, most people suck at it, and most people spend way too much time on it. Really, on my very first video that I posted on this YouTube channel, I spent 20 plus hours on the research, and then I edited for my second draft, and then I did even more research because I really wanted to have the perfect script, but I made a lot of mistakes along the way.

 Right now, I've refined the process. Now, I'm going to teach you everything that you need to know about research so you'll know how to research the right way in less time. I'm going to teach you my full research framework that allows me to write viral bangers over and over again. So, we first have to understand why does good research make such a big impact? Because research is the foundation of the video.

And most people like me make these following research mistakes. They either spend too much time on research, they don't know when to stop research, so they keep going on and on and on with research. and the research takes an infinite amount of time for them in which case they don't actually publish their video or they research poorly.

 The research is not thorough enough. The research is not done proper. And in order to stop making these following mistakes, you have to understand research at a deeper level, which is exactly what we're going to talk about. Research is made up of these four parts. And I'm going to go over how to actually understand these four parts and how to execute them in your research for your next video.

 And then I'm also going to demonstrate how I do it and, you know, put it together in a doc, do it in real time for you for a video on YouTube. So first is audience understanding and then it's competitor analysis and then you want to gather the content video and then you want to validate. So audience understanding is know what they need, want and care about.

 Competitor analysis is spotting trends, gaps and winning strategies in your niche. Gathering content is you know actually what you're going to talk about in the video, right? So you want to collect facts, examples and unique insights that add value. And then you want to validate which is to doublech checkck any information that you have for accuracy and relevance.

 We need to research each part as deeply as possible. So, I'm going to cover the easiest strategies you can follow to cover all of these points and make sure that you have the most in-depth research that you can have. So, we're going to talk about how to find the perfect video length, how to find and talk about the right points.

 And then we're going to talk about how to stand out from the crowd with your research because really your research if you're writing documentary scripts, educational scripts, is one of the ways to stand out from the crowd, just having more deep researched videos that are just better than your competitors. And then we're going to talk about how to study the right videos by figuring out which videos are worth studying and how to implement research properly.

 Because really any mistake within research can make your video tank. So for example, if you use the wrong video length, a video that could have been 8 minutes, you script it as 25 minutes. That means that the video just won't perform well. There's a lot of fluff. Or a video that you scripted to be 8 minutes that should be instead 25 minutes means that you're missing a ton of information that you could have added.

 And when you add that information, you could have had longer watch time. So let's figure out the video length. The wrong length can lose viewers. Too short equals you're missing details. Too long equals viewers click away. Both of which you don't want to happen. So let's look at an example, right? Same niche, same topic, right? How to learn any language without studying.

 This video is too long, right? And then there's just shorts, right? Which is obviously too short. But if you have the right video length here, you can see 12 minutes long. Can you learn a language without studying? Same topic, but this one got outsized returns at 502K views. Same with this, right? How to learn your dream language without studying, right? Just nice length, 12 minutes, right? Same niche and same topic.

 doesn't mean that you know same niche and same topic all the time it has to be this exact same length but this is more just kind of a guidance so you kind of have an idea of hey when I'm doing research how long should my video be rather than just shooting and guessing and just scripting out spooly or not scripting it out enough so how to find the perfect video length you want to align the length with your video format if it's short right if it's quick tips or skits right then the video will be 2 to 5 minutes long if you know it's medium length 6 to 12 minutes that's usually for tutorials or reviews or kind of like how-tos and then long is if you feel like hey within the niche right deep dives case studies are performing really well longer videos are performing really well then I'm going to make slightly longer videos so let's get a little bit more tactical this is kind of highle thinking okay we want to align the length with the specific format of the video because the longer the video the more info and value you need to add for example a short video you'll have quick tips comparisons and you won't really have any detailed instructions because you don't have the capacity to go super in-depth in a short video whereas in a long video in the same topic, right? How to improve your pull-up strength quickly and easily. You

go more in depth. You have five to six main payoffs, main points that you want to talk about. And you have detailed instructions on how to actually implement it. And then you have a medium length video with more to the point tips. Has three to five main points, detailed instructions, but still fast enough to only include the most important part.

 So, it's really more concise, right? Really, the difference in the video length is how much information you can put in and how much in depth. Just because you have a longer video length doesn't mean that you can have fluff and doesn't mean that you can add useless information that's not useful to the viewer.

 Right? We want to make sure that every single piece of information that you give the viewer is useful, is actionable, and can actually add value to them. So, for example, in the case of this video that you're watching, this is a much longer video than the videos that I usually post, right? This will be a fulllength course where we break down a specific skill, aka YouTube script writing.

 But the caveat is right, you'll see a lot of courses out there that are 6 hours long, 11 hours long, 12 hours long, 20 hours long. And the problem with those courses is that the average view duration of those courses would likely still be 6 7 minutes. The perceived length of it might be super long, but those videos might just not perform well because the content isn't super valuable.

 What you don't really see behind the scenes when I'm creating a course like this that's full super in-depth is that actually I create a bunch of content and I have to delete them because after a while I realized after watching the recording that hey this content isn't super valuable to the audience right I can't just be making a video to be super long for the sake of it being super long I want it to be super long but the value per minute the amount of value that I injecting to the video is so high and the video is so valuable that it's impossible possible for the viewer to not want to watch from start to finish in one sitting. So for example, if this video ends up being 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours long. I want to make sure that hey the content is actually valuable enough that the viewer wants to watch from start to finish in one sitting, not just, you know, watch in one chunk and then hey, we hit a point in the course where it's actually not super useful. No one really cares. The information is very subpar. I'm just using it to increase the video length. That doesn't work. So when you think about the video length, every single piece of information that you give is super crucial. So let's talk about this,

right? But what about this topic? Same niche plus topic, right? 10 years of muscle building advice in 23 minutes, right? This one performed really well. 1.4 million views. How I built muscle fast, right? 9 minutes. Does that mean that oh, like super long and medium length videos are good? How do we kind of diagnose like what kind of video length we should have? Well, really, when you're thinking about, hey, should I make a video of this length or make a video of that length? And we're breaking down the videos in the niche that have performed really well, we want to think about what are the reasons that it would have performed well. In this case, the actual points in both videos are informative and actionable, right? Regardless of its length, right? Which is why we need to know how to pick the right points we cover in our video. The points that we pick in the video and what we actually talk about is equally important as the length of the video. As I previously discussed, right, by making a super long course will cut a lot of information to make sure that it's actually the most valuable thing that you can be watching with your time. So, we've already figured out how to find the perfect video length. Let's talk about how to find and talk about the right points and how this links to figuring out the perfect video length for your video. So, there are certain videos that get better performance because they number one engage the

audience by delivering exactly what they came for. So, the title will set certain expectations for the viewer and the actual content has to deliver on it. So, the better that your content delivers on the click, the better that those videos will perform. Number two, it keeps retention high by focusing on relevant and valuable insights.

 Once again, the research of your video needs to be focused on the value per minute. So, it's how much value that you're giving to the viewer per minute that they give you, right? So, if there is more insights per minute, then it's more likely that they stay and that keeps retention high because what you're telling them is actually valuable and not just fluff.

 And it ensures their video stands out with unique and fresh information. So, it's not just copy paste of what other people are talking about within the niche. It's using unique and fresh information that is kind of your insights, your learned experiences that no one else is really talking about.

 And that way, every video that you make is a hit. So, when you're looking for potential payoffs and potential points that you want to talk about in your video, you want to avoid covering too much because when you talk about too many points, say in a 10-minute video, you talk about eight different points, that leads to a lack of depth.

 So, you're not able to explain each point as in depth as you'd like. And when you don't explain a point super in-depth, you go very surface level. audience that you tend to attract tends to be very surface level, too. And it's also choosing points you like, but your audience doesn't really care about. So, when you create content, audience is first.

 You always want to be thinking about, hey, how does my content serve my audience? It's usually less about, hey, this is what I like to talk about, right? It's more about what does my audience find the most valuable? And then you deliver that for your audience. And it's also repeating the same points everyone else uses.

 So, you don't just want to be a robot. You want to have your own unique points within your research. And if you know how to research good points, that's how you have every video hit, right? Every video is valuable. Every video has the chance to get watched by millions of viewers. Or if you're in a tiny niche, your video needs to have the chance to be viewed by everyone within your niche.

 So, say there's only 100,000 people in your niche, your video must be good enough, must be valuable enough that it can be watched by those 100,000 people in your niche. That's how you really maximize the number of views that you can potentially get. You just need to know how to find and talk about the right points.

 And to pick the right payoffs in your video, you need to ask yourself this question. What is lacking from other videos out there? So, what I do when I do my research, and I'll show you what that kind of looks like, is you want to look at existing videos out there. You want to find content gaps, and you want to script your video to build on those points.

 You don't just watch existing videos and copy paste what everyone else is talking about. You want to look at their videos, create a thesis for what the content gap is, what people aren't talking about, and then you script those videos and build on those points. So once again, watch the top three to five videos in your niche.

Write down their key points here. In this case, how I learned to handstand hold, right? Develop shoulder strength and balance, practice pike holds and push-ups, improve balance with claw-like grip. Or this video, right? How to handstand for a long time. Same topic right here. He talks about wall exercises, build confidence, chest to wall for alignment, heal and toe pulls for balance.

 Apparently, that's how you handstand for a long time. And then you also want to watch the videos and figure out, okay, where are the peaks in retention, right? To choose the points that viewers care most about. That's where usually there's the most amount of valuable information given or that's where people rewatch.

 And then you also want to check comments on competitor videos, right? There might be frequently asked questions, right? Maybe there's complaints or missing details. Hey, you should make a video on this. Hey, you should make a video on this. In my case, if you see a lot of my comment section, a lot of people made comments on, hey, can you do a video on research? So that's why I'm including a research section as part of this full course.

 So hopefully this helps answer any questions that people have about research and then maybe I can also post a standalone video that just talks about research on its own. So let's say we want to make a video about holding handstands. So once again we analyze competitive videos. We pick the most interesting points from the videos as I just talked about and after checking the comments we want to create a list of points we want to mention in our own video.

 So this is part of the research right? What other people talking about? What can I talk about? It's a content gap. It is different from what other people are talking about. So here you can see the comments say, "How should I rotate my shoulders in a handstand externally or internally? Any advice on elbow tricep pain coming from practicing HS holds? When to do handstand hold before handstand push-ups or off the handstand push-ups? Can we do handstand walking ground for 15 minutes continuous onset? And can we deep breath during handstands? Right? So there's a bunch of questions here and after checking the comments, we can create a list of our own points that we want to mention in our videos." Right? So we can say hey right what are the common mistakes when people are doing a handstand right what's the importance of balance right examples of exercises to build balance right that's kind of the gap you can see there are people asking questions at common FAQs that we can then turn into potential video ideas and the reason why this process is so important and the reason I follow this with every video that we make is because it helps us improve the quality of existing videos we don't just want to make the same quality of videos as everyone else when we're writing the script the script aka the content is a great way to stand out from everyone else. If the script is

better, aka the words that you say, and in the case of educational videos, the words that you say are pretty much the only important thing when it comes to standing out or giving better information, right? The words that you say dictate storytelling. It dictates the insights. It dictates what the viewer will learn from you.

 And then there's like the vanity stuff, which is like the lighting, the camera, the background. All of those have to be good, but the words are the most impactful. And really when we nail down this research process and we pick the right points, it really helps us improve the quality of the existing videos, it helps us improve the insights that we're giving the viewer.

 It's a lot higher quality. It's a lot better. So great content needs great execution. And really small improvements to the existing videos leads to big viewer retention. And there are many ways to improve the quality of your videos. And I will cover the best ways to create content that stands out from other videos.

 So let's talk about how to stand out from the crowd. A couple ways to do this, right? Number one, ask for feedback, right? Use polls or ask for comments. What do you want to see next? Usually, your audience will give you some sort of signal for, hey, what titles are good? Hey, what specific topics that you want to cover? Your audience can give you potential signals.

They're not always accurate, but this is one of the couple data points that you can collect in order to get certain video ideas and, you know, stand out from the crowd in terms of your script. You can also study your analytics, right? You can go to your YouTube studio and analyze retention curves, right? Where do people usually drop off? So, what topics do people find boring? what what topics do people not find as useful? And then you can look at your CTR, right? Are your thumbnails and titles working? What kind of like stands out for your audience? And for example, if your intros lose viewers, you want to try different hooks, right? Different hook formats, right? And that way you can keep making changes until you actually see improvements. One of the things that keeps viewers from clicking away is having a killer hook, something that really stands out because the killer hook will grab attention and set the tone for the whole video. And the easiest way to find banger hooks is to research whatever is working right now. So another big part of the research that we do is what hooks are working in the niche, right? And really people think that with hooks, right, you need to completely change the game. You need to completely outsopicate what's out there. But that's not necessarily the case. You don't need to reinvent the wheel, right? One of the quotes that my friend told me the other day is that just because it's your wheel doesn't mean that you need to

reinvent it, right? There's a bunch of proven winning formulas out there. And we're going to talk about how to write hooks, how to come up with your own hooks in a little bit. But once again, part of the research, figuring out what's working, find the gap, double down on it.

 what's working in other niches, replicate that in your niche. You don't need to change the game. That's why we do in-depth research so that we don't have to strain our brain with all of this crazy brain power. So, picking hooks in your niche base it on your niche, right? Look at look at the hooks that other videos in your niche are already using.

 For example, in this one, becoming less addicted to YouTube is easy actually. That starts with so if you've ever never running out of things to say is easy actually and the easy actually niche, right? Have you ever wondered why dot dot dot and then from there you can test hooks, right? You can create two to three versions of your intro, track which gets better retentions in YouTube analytics over a couple videos, and you can keep the best performing hook for similar future videos, right? Or whether it's in the same format or whe it's talking about the same topic, you can do the research, figure out what hooks are working, and then you can just use those, right? That's a big part of research, too. So, I've been teaching you how to refine hooks, payoffs, and video length from other videos, but which videos are actually worth studying? How do you know which videos are worth studying? Because you can't always base it off the views. If you look at these two videos, how to unf your brain by modern ideas got 3 million views and how to force your brain to crave doing hard things has 2.6 million views. How do you know which do you study for success? Right? They are two vastly very different videos, but both videos have found great success. Both of them are in the multi-million view range, but vastly different length. One is like a personal brand. Uh the other is more of like a commentary video if you've seen these videos on YouTube.

So, how do you pick which one to study? You might think it's this because it has more views, but not necessarily, right? Because both videos has their strengths and weaknesses. For example, how to unf your brain, right? If you watch this video, not that great of a hook, right? Info information is not new, right? It's good for beginners and self-improvement.

That's why it's shorter. It's a short video and it's easier to digest. And in this video, how to force your brain to crave doing hard things. It has a better hook. The information is new. It's very long, but it's harder for beginners to get into and watch all the way through because the concepts are a little bit more abstract.

 Really, your goal is to find the strengths and implement them in your own videos. So, for this one, right, it's good for beginners and self-improvement. Short video, easy to digest. This one has a better hook and the information is new or it was new for when it was being posted. So, how do you figure out the strengths and weaknesses in a specific video? I've created a system to help you study the right YouTube videos.

 And it's more of a grading system so that you know what to look out for in which videos, what to implement, and what not to. Let's get into it. Okay, so you can look at any video in your niche and find all of their strengths. And that way, you can make your videos even better, right? you can have better hooks, have better storytelling, etc.

, etc. So, we just talked about which videos are worth studying. Let's talk about how to implement your research properly and some actionable tips here. So, I've created a grading system to help us find the best videos to study. Let's look at it. Just watch your target videos once and grade them and it'll only take 15 minutes.

 So, when you grade a YouTube video, you can take a screenshot of this page. You want to have insight. You want to rate it on its insight. How original and actionable is the information? Then, you want to rate it on hooks, right? How well does the hook grab attention? The pacing. Is the video engaging or is it dragging? Is it way too slow? So, that's kind of seeing the emotion that you feel when you're watching the video or it's kind of noticing yourself.

 Hey, when do I feel like clicking off or like is this video going too fast? Is it going too slow? This guy speaking way too fast. He's speaking way too slow. Which one is it? And then it's tonality, right? Does the tone match the content and the audience? The storytelling, right? Are the narratives clear and compelling or can the storytelling be improved? And then it's looking at the editing, right? Are the visuals and audio seamless and professional? So you want to create the depth and originality of information presented aka the insights the value to the target audience whether what you're actually talking about is practical actionable or thoughtprovoking and you know within that is it basic knowledge is it competent knowledge or is it exceptional knowledge right basic it's you know it repeats common knowledge right lacks depth no unique perspective the video usually won't perform well if it's super duper common knowledge that everyone has heard of but if it's exceptional right it's unique actionable insights that surprise or challenges the audience's expectations so it's grading the video on insights really you want Identify the three to five main points in the video as we would have in the previous part of research. Search similar content and compare uniqueness and detail and score high if the video adds a new perspective or introduces new fresh ideas. So once again, this is what

we gradeed on, right? Is it basic, competent, or exceptional? So let's grade this video's insight, right? The most underrated social skill and how I use it. It's got 1.6 million views, right? If you look at the level of insight, it's not anything super crazy, right? It's I would consider it grade two, which is competent.

 And why this grade? It's because the video shares helpful tips, but the ideas are basic and not unique. You can go watch the video yourself if you like. And if you would actually improve the content of the video, you can add data or studies about active listening, right? Share rare insights about Carl Rogers methods.

I use examples from different areas like business or leadership. This is just stuff that you can come up with right when you're watching the video, right? And eventually if you use this grading system whenever you're watching a YouTube video, it's like if you're a film student watching a movie, you understand film and when you watch a movie, you're like thinking, okay, how did they do this? Like VFX effects, right? How do I feel about the storytelling? It's the exact same thing when you're watching a YouTube video or when you're watching a YouTube script. You'll be able to ask yourself, hey, how would I improve this video? And almost automatically, if you ask yourself, hey, how would I improve this video? Is the information basic? How do I feel when I'm watching the video? Eventually, you'll have a good feel when you're watching a YouTube video, right? What you'd improve. And then when you write your own script, that will give you more of a baseline in order to compare the content itself. And then you'll notice how you can is sophisticate on what's already happening in your niche. How can you create better content than what's already being created in your niche? And then you want to grade the hooks, right? So you want to look at effectiveness of the opening seconds in grabbing attention, emotional or curiosity based triggers. You want to grade it on that. So once again, grading hooks, right? basics generic opening doesn't really

stand out like welcome to my channel and exceptional is instantly grabs attention with an emotional shocking highly relatable statement I wasted $50,000 before learning the secret so it's looking at the hooks looking at the first lines looking at the first 30 seconds so watch the first 15 seconds 15 to 30 seconds ask would I keep watching score high if the hook creates emotional engagement or curiosity immediately all of this once again is part of your research is figuring out what's working your niche and really if you're looking at okay the hooks is graded a little bit lower I can improve on the hooks that's a way to improve on the script Right? And then I'll note that so within my actual writing the script, I'll know, hey, the hooks need to be graded above what is currently out there. And then I'll write a hook that's above the grade. Or if the storytelling isn't as good, I'm going to okay index above the storytelling that's happening in the niche. So once again, these three criteria. So once again, if you look at this video, you grade the hooks, right? Grade two, right? The hook is interesting, but doesn't clearly show why the viewers would care. So I would literally write this down when I am creating a video for the first time. So improvement steps, right? You want to promise value in the first line like wants better relationships. This method will transform how you connect. And then you want to test two to three hook styles to see what works best. And then afterwards, you want to grade pacing,

right? That's the next criteria, right? The rhythm and flow of the video. Does it maintain viewer interest or are they overly long or rushed segments? So basic is slow, drawn out, disorganized. And exceptional is consistently engaging with a balance between quick delivery and welltimed pauses for emphasis.

 So not too fast, not too slow. That's exceptional. So great, right? Use time stamps to note any sections that feel too slow or too rushed. And it's looking for transitions that keep the viewer hooked between points. It's also generally how you feel right when you are watching a video and gauging the pacing based on that.

 So once again watch this video maybe the grading will be too. Some sections move too fast making hard to process key points in which case if the if the pacing feels a little bit too fast then maybe an improvement of the video is that oh I could make the video longer instead of having such a short video. So improvement steps would be to break ideas into smaller parts right pause off the key points to let them sink in and use visuals to slow things down and clarify.

 So next thing that we want to grade is tonality. So it's how well the tone matches the video's purpose and the target audience. So that's looking at energy, enthusiasm, relatability, right? Part of this is also like music design. If you're looking at like documentaries or maybe the creator is just not as expressive, pretty boring, voice is like super duper monotone and yeah, no one wants to listen to the guy for a super duper long time, right? So it's grading on all of that.

 And really, if you have one main other competitor in your niche and his tonality sucks, his camera presence sucks, you can just improve on that. If you can just overindex on that, that's also a great way to stand out, right? And and you wouldn't actually figure this out unless you did some research on on your main competitors.

 So basic is like monotone delivery. Tone is mismatched with the audience. Not quite a good vibe, right? And then exceptional is a perfect match for the topic and audience with dynamic energy and emotional connection. So you want to grade, right? to check if the tone aligns with the niche and score high if the presenter's energy feels natural and engaging.

 So, if you look at the tonality of this video, I would say it's pretty good. The tone is friendly and engaging and makes it easy to follow, right? That's kind of the feel of the video. That's also the feel that the thumbnail gives. So, it's meant to be friendly, meant to be engaging, not supposed to be like super duper hardcore with all of these like visual effects style. It's easy, friendly, engaging.

It's like talking to a friend. And then even if it's at a tree, there's still certain improvement steps, right? You could keep the tone but balance casual and professional for serious moments so that there's more like up and down. There's like a flow in terms of the feeling that the video evokes.

 And then you can add emphasis to important ideas to keep attention. And then storytelling next, right? You want to create clarity and structure of the narrative, emotional or logical connection through personal anecdotes, examples. So what is the level of storytelling? And you grade it once again basic exceptional no clear narrative versus masterful storytelling.

And then look for beginning, middle to end is how you grade it. And then score high if the personal stories or analogies enhance understanding or relatability. Once again, it's looking at the story and asking yourself how do you feel after the story, right? Are the story components strong or not? If it's not strong, you can once again index over that when you're writing your next script.

 So, if I were to grade the storytelling, I'll probably grade it at a three. It's pretty good. And then grading the editing, right? You want to grade the visuals, audio, transitions to support the content. And then the professional polish and engagement um true creative editing, you you want to have a look at that.

 So once again basic to exceptional minimal editing or poor audio visual quality uh versus exceptional right seamless transitions clear visuals audio creative use of it effects to enhance engagement right what's the level of editing so note if visuals or audio align with the pacing and the content and then you want to score it high if you feel the editing improves clarity focus and viewer retention if not it's not it's not graded high and then in this video it's great too but it's also great too maybe it's cuz it's meant to be great too right it's uh it's also like a stickman um more of like a edited drawing maybe Maybe it's meant to feel that way. So maybe it could be a two, maybe it could be a three. It's up for debate, right? But not to say that you need to get the exact grade correct, right? This is more of like a feel that you have from watching the video, right? Other people would grade it a little bit differently. Other people would grade it similarly to you. So it's not about getting the grading exactly right, but it's having an index to, hey, right, this is where I think the video can be improved. Maybe the storytelling is actually really objectively really really strong just that you don't think it's that strong because you don't have a great

understanding of storytelling yet and then in your next video you try to index above on the storytelling and it doesn't work out. But that's totally fine because really we do this deep research so that we can understand hey how can we get an edge over a competitor's videos. How can we make videos better than the competitor? How can we make videos that is better than what's existing out there? It's having that understanding that allows us to, hey, right, we can improve on this. Sometimes, are we wrong? Yes. Does the video perform worse because we're wrong? Yeah, sometimes that happens. But when we're correct, usually it's because we do all of these minor tiny tiny research and we change up the points that we talk about and our camera presence improves. Uh, the points that we pick in the video specifically improve. That's when we really get outsized returns from our research, right? That's what that's how we get videos that are 10x, 20x, 50x outliers because we did this research and we really understand the niche very well. We understand the topic very very well. There we go. Now we need to take our grades and then apply it to our videos.

So let's talk about how to implement this research properly. So you want to create a spreadsheet or chart, right? List each category as a column and evaluate videos with one to three grades. And you want to add notes, right? You want to write specific observations for each category, right? the hook was too emotional but too long and then you want to make a final assessment to share your thoughts.

 Does it have to be this systematic when you're doing your research? No, not necessarily. Maybe you understand your niche really well, but you want to have a good idea on where you can index above what's happening within your niche. Right? For me, I've kind of done this for literally like hundreds of different channels at this point.

 just like doing all of this research, understanding these different niches, writing for all of these different niches for my clients at Viral Bangers. We run a YouTube script writing agency. So, um I can do this in my head, but if you are new to the system and you're really trying to figure out, okay, how can I grade? How can I overindex over certain videos right now? How do I decide what points to pick from this whole sea of uh sea of payoffs that I can possibly take from all these books that I've researched? This is a pretty good system, right? So then you want to write this down specifically. And if you click the link in the description, I have a workbook for you to follow these exact steps where you can have all of my templates. Uh so you can just click the link in description and get access to that workbook directly. And then number three is actionable takeaways, right? highlight what worked well and how it can be applied to your videos because there's no point in having all of these learnings if you don't apply to your video. Make sense? There you go. Overall grade 2.5. Good for room for improvement. It's for for the previous video we talked about, right? Video is engaging but could be elevated, clearer

hooks, better pacing, and more effective visual editing. So, there you go. Now you have the right tools to research effectively to avoid common mistakes and to create content that stands out. Next step, go apply this framework to your next video. Test, tweak, repeat. success comes with action.

 And before you go and apply this on your own, I'm going to show you right now how I think about research um for a famous YouTuber and how I actually go about writing a script that way and that way you can follow my exact thought process. I'm going to speak it out loud and visualize it so that you can hopefully go and implement all of this.

 So, let's switch screens real quick. So, now I'm going to show you how I do research and I'm going to show you how I think about it um when I'm writing for one of the biggest YouTubers out there. Okay. So, if we look at his page right now, his name's Imongi, almost 6 million subscribers, probably the biggest business channel um first or second biggest um for business and entrepreneurship.

 He has this video that he just posted, right? How to escape the rat race without quitting your 9 to5. So, I I I want to show you how I think about writing the script for this. So, if you watch this video, a couple characteristics that comes to mind, right? If you look at few stats here, if you look at the ranking, uh this video isn't performing insanely well.

 So, I think the script could use a little bit more help, a little bit of like dialing in. So, how to skip the rat race without quitting your nineto-5, right? If we look at it from a title standpoint, it's actually like pretty good. So, what I want to do if I were to hand me this specific video, right? Okay. How to escape the rat race. I would just search here number one, how to escape the rat race, and I want to see what immediately pops up.

 And then this would pretty much be looking at competitors within the same topic, right? Because how to escape the rat race isn't like a super new concept. Um I want to see what other people are talking about, what points they have, and then from there I can kind of evaluate, okay, what's a good video length and um yeah, like what are all the base research points that we have? And I'm pretty much just doing this all raw.

 So if I stumble a little bit, um you can see it all live. So over here this James Yanny right escaping the rat race what school failed to teach you about money how to escape the rat race fastest method right how to escape the 9 to5 job uh all these have done okay right 0.4x 2x so here you can see the outlier score there is this um four ways to quit the rat race so like one of the really great things about having like older videos within the niche is that you can usually like repurpose certain points from this if if some of the points aren't like super duper outdated and some of the points are still relevant till today. What's really informative is if you can use old principles and you can repackage it uh for a modern world, right? So, for example, um what Iman is kind of pushing right now is, hey, you want to learn how to sell digital products in order to make money, right? So, if there are like certain principles from this, right, four ways to quit the rat race that I can use and I can actually like implement um in my script, that would be super ideal. See here, escape the rat race, how I did it. Here, the psychology of money. That's not quite it.

Right. So, there's this 318x, right? What's this? This is a neuroscientist. So, a couple ideas here already, right? So, I like a couple videos that I just want to look at. So, I'm going to take this. I'm going to start a new dock. And I'm just going to paste videos of like competitors that I kind of want to look at.

 So, I want to look at this, too, just so I have like certain parameters for what I'm looking at. This one, I'm picking this channel cuz this is also like a financial channel. It's also like talking head. It's um more like her style, more like friendly um immongi style. Um but this video performed pretty well. 531k. Um there's also like a neuroscientist perspective that I also want to have.

 So there's like certain things that you can do within the points when you're talking about the payoff is you can be like, "Hey, this is a neuroscientist perspective on how to escape the rat race." And then that could be a different angle for the points that you talk about.

 So I want to take a couple other points here, right? how I escaped the rat race at 24. Uh, this is more of a personal angle. I mean, this one is pretty recent a year ago, so I'm also going to take this. I mean, why not and see what happens. Alan Watts, 146k views. Nothing too crazy. Um, let's see here. How to escape wage slavery.

 So, there's also this uh this one also did pretty well, right? Carlton Dennis. So, let me just put this over here. Okay. So maybe these are like the main ones that we want to look at. And then what I want to do from this is I want to determine a couple things. I want to determine what is like a good video length, right? And I also want to determine what points I can mention that will help me stand out, right? And of course, if I were to write for Iman, I would have access to him and I would be able to ask his team or like ask himself, okay, what are the specific points that you want to talk about? Right? And then uh from there I will be able to package it in terms of what I see is working or like kind of like the pros um within all of these other video ideas. But I don't have access to him. So let's just come up with a couple points that you know we think could be could be pretty interesting, right? Just just based on watching these. So, um, a great way to like, you know, like I ideally you have the time to like sit

down and watch all of these videos, but sometimes you just don't have like let me just take this how to skip the rat race. But, um, if you're like me and you're making a video right now and you're doing a live walkthrough, sometimes you just don't have the time to watch through all of these videos.

So, what you can do is you can go here. You can just take the transcript and then you can um, and then you can ask claw to summarize what the main points are. So I'm just going to take this. I'm going to copy transcript. I'm going to go here. I'm going to go to claude. And then here summarize the main points.

 So here it can very easily like give you like what the main strategies are. And then from here you can also pick right what are the most insightful where kind of there are overlaps from certain points and also which are most on brand for Iman right based on like his goals for the video.

 Right? So realize you're not depend on anyone. Find your flow state for your free time first, then work, right? Diversify your identity. Set boundaries and don't people, please. Okay, that's fine. And I'm just going to do this for the rest of these videos. Okay, let's talk about hooks, which I think is probably one of the most important parts in a script cuz the first 30 seconds really determines the performance of the video, right? Determines whether people will continue watching.

 So hundreds of YouTube script writers send me their scripts asking me to review them every single month. So we have Discord, Red Hook reviews, blah blah blah. Lots of people ask me to review the hooks. And there's one common problem that I see in their scripts. It's that their hooks suck. Everybody always asks me to review the hooks.

That's what we spend the most amount of time reviewing. So let's talk about everything you need to learn about hooks. what they are, why you need them, elements of an effective hook, common mistakes I see most script writers make, how to fix those mistakes, and write better open loops, right? 10 types of hooks, and a breakdown of my best personal hooks.

 Let's get into everything that's going to be full guide. Uh, pretty much everything that I know about hooks. So, what are hooks and why you need them? The hook is the very first line to reel the viewer in. You have less than 30 seconds before the viewer decides to watch the rest of the video or continue watching till the end.

So for YouTube specifically, the first 30 seconds is where the drop off is the most, right? Average attention span shrunk from 12 seconds in the year 2000 to just 8 seconds a day, which is less than a literal goldfish. It's pretty bad stuff going on. So the drop of the hook is to do two things, right? Validate the click on the video and create intrigue so that they want to watch the rest of the video.

 And if you nail the hook, your retention in the first 30 seconds will be upwards of 40 to 50%. Right? Average view view duration gets higher. Obviously, retention in the first 30 seconds kind of varies across niches. So, let's talk about what makes a good hook because strong hooks equals more retention equals higher retention and higher average view duration.

 So, the goal of the hook is to do one thing, right? It's to reel the view in to watch the rest of the video. And in order to do that, the hook needs the following elements. It needs to be clear. It needs to avoid any jargon. And it needs to engage the viewer directly. So, be clear.

 For example, of a clear hook is in this video, we're going to talk about digital products, right? It's very clear. It tells you exactly what you're going to talk about. So needs to be clear. Being clear is one of the pillars of effective writing in general, effective copyrightiting, effective script writing.

 So you need to be clear in your hook, especially if you want to reel the viewer in. Cannot be complex, cannot be filled with jargon. Example of an unclear hook is right, digital products can make you a lot of money. Like what does a lot of money mean, right? You don't want to be vague. And part of being clear is avoiding jargon, right? So example of no jargon is that you need thousands of sales to make a profit. It's just not true.

 your profit is going to rely on your AB testing scales, CTR and more. Lots of jargon that means like niche specific uh words, right? Kind of depends, right? If you are really going for niche specific audience, then yes, but for the most part, no one's really going to know what CTR is or AB testing skills.

 You want to keep it the hook as broad as possible so that as many people can watch it as possible and then you niche down from there. So, keep it simple. And then you want to engage directly, right? So, example of engaging directly is that you need to get good at ads. If you want to if you want to see your business succeed, so tell the viewer directly, right? Or just saying people need to get good at ads.

 So that means addressing the viewer directly rather than beating around the bush and you know kind of going in circles. You don't want to do that. So once again, right, you want to avoid jargon. You want to avoid overexplaining. So that's like selling the viewer too hard. And you want to avoid excessive credentials, right? It means credentials are not necessary.

It's just like telling the viewer um too many things, right? So it's elements of an effective hook. And literally, I've seen hundreds of script writers repeat these mistakes over and over again. If you've watched my other videos, I would have kind of explained this a little bit more high level, but we're going to go into the specifics here.

 So, example number one, let's see if you guys can find out what's wrong with this hook. So, I'm just going to read it out loud. The only thing separating you from success as a coach is a killer strategy. I'm about to teach you one that can optimize your client acquisition funnel, scale your MR to $100,000 in 30 days.

And after X years helping coaches convert more prospects and improve the LTV metrics, I've seen hundreds of mistakes being repeated over and over again. Poor ROAS, inefficient pipelines, and churned clients that kill scalability, right? And so in this video, I've decided to share the simplest strategy that I and countless other coaches have tried and tested, and you can use it to hit 100K in MR in only 30 days.

 So what's wrong with this hook? What which one of the big mistakes is this? Right? If you don't already know, big mistake in this is that there's just excessive jargon, right? Client acquisition funnel, scale your MR, LTV metrics, proess, inefficient pipelines, insurance clients. If we're using all of these big jargon, if there are, you know, there will be people who can enjoy your content that you're immediately alienating.

 So, you want to keep the jargon to a minimum. And then later in the video, if you want to introduce a jargon, explain what it is, and then you can talk about it. So, let's fix those issues. Now, we're going to simplify it, right? The only thing separating you from success as a coach is a killer strategy.

 I'm about to teach you one that can make you 100k in 30 days. After X years helping coaches close more clients, I've seen hundreds of mistakes being repeated over and over again. Bad offers, sales funnels that go nowhere, and clients that leave after a month. You see, it's a lot simpler right now. It's still a little bit of jargon, right? Offer sales funnels, but more people know what it is, right? Um, and it's more easily palatable and enjoyable by a broader audience.

 Yeah, look at the difference. Okay, let's look at number two. What's the second mistake? Right. I made 7,400 Baba videos to crack going viral. I spent countless hours researching, testing, editing, and analyzing trends, hashtag, engagement metrics just to figure out what works. Super long sentence.

 If you follow these tips, you could go from having nobody watching your content to having thousands and millions of views and followers. Once you understand how to create high-quality short form content, you'll be able to build a dedicated audience who will be throwing likes, shares, and comments under every video that you post.

 Even just reading this, it feels off, right? So, like, what is off about this? Let's see if you can figure out what's wrong. That once again, it's overexlaining. It's selling the view the video too hard. So, it's giving the viewer information that they don't need in order to continue watching.

 Really, in writing, the first line is to get you to the second line. Second line is to get you to the third line. Third line is to get you to the fourth line. Same thing in a YouTube video, right? Um title and thumbnail is going to get you to click. First sentence is of the video is to get you to watch to the second sentence. So, first 5 seconds gets you to watch the first 30 seconds.

 First 30 seconds get you gets you to watch point one. Point one gets you to watch point two. Point two gets you to watch point three. It's pretty much this sequence that you want to follow when you are writing a video. And if the first sentence doesn't get you to the second sentence, then the first sentence can be cut, right? Or the first sentence has to be modified.

 So that's really what I want to think about. So let's see how this is simplified. So I made 7,400 barber videos to crack going viral. And if you follow these tips, you could go from having nobody watching your content to having thousands and millions of views and followers.

 You've already heard all the common tips like using a good amount of hashtags, writing a great hook, posting consistently, but you haven't heard about the three golden pillars every viral video is built upon. And if you take advantage of these pillars, I guarantee you'll see an improvement in your own videos. So, it's a lot simpler.

It's less mouthful and it's a lot clearer, right? The outcome that the viewer gets is a lot clearer. You getting to make sense? Can you see kind of the difference? If this seems laughable, really a lot of your videos have the exact same problems, right? You use you overexlain in the hook when really the hook is just to get the viewer to watch the rest of the video.

Okay, let's look at option number three. Example number three, Alexozi, one of the most successful entrepreneurs of all time with a hund00 million portfolio and countless accolades to his name, uses code outreach to generate millions of leads across his companies without lifting a finger.

 If you haven't heard of him, Hermosi is the founder of Gym Launch, which revolutionized the fitness industry, and he's also the author of several bestselling videos on business and scaling. He's featured on countless podcast and is highly regarded in the entrepreneurial world as a master of sales and marketing strategies.

 And today, I'm going to review his full code email strategy, the very strategy that saved Jim Launch from bankruptcy when he was at the brink of losing it all. So, what's wrong with this hook? Right, three mistakes. There's one more left. It's too many credentials, right? You can see here there's a whole paragraph of his credentials.

 Really, with credentials, we just need one line so that I know, okay, this guy knows what he's talking about and it's related to the video, right? You don't just want to give random credentials, right? It's kind of odd when someone comes up to you on the street and they just give you the most random credentials.

 It's like who asked, but the who asked, you can kind of answer it if it's related to the video itself. So, you want to make sure that the credentials is related to the video. And in this case, it's kind of adjacently related, but it's not clear how it's fully fully fully related. So, just want to modify this.

 So, if you just simplified it, Horoszi uses code outreach to generate millions of leads across his portfolio companies without lifting a finger. And today, I'm going to to be revealing Alexi's full coding strategy. This is the exact strategy that saved his company, Gym Launch, during a time when it seemed like it it was about to go bankrupt.

 So, how does Alex Moszi do it? I've spent the past week breaking down his strategy so you don't have to. I'll boil it down to four key steps and make his co- email strategy effective. So just simplify, right? Less credentials. See the difference? So once again, to avoid these mistakes, right? You want to replace jargon, cut the fluff, trim the credentials, right? Use clear everyday language, right? Instead of prospects, say customers, right? Deliver value first.

 Don't oversell and let the intrigue do the work. And only include what's necessary to build trust. A lot of writing a great hook is avoiding the mistakes, right? So like the way that I think about, you know, writing great scripts or really being great at anything, it's like if you want to get rich, it's just avoid the dumb decisions, right? That's I think that's one of Charlie Mer's quotes.

 So really, you just want to avoid the mistakes and generally you'll do pretty well in your scripts because so many scripts out there have all of these mistakes. So really if you just follow these principles, avoid these mistakes, your hooks will be a ton better. You could literally edit your hooks based on these.

 So a few extra tips, right? We need to be conscious about the kind of viewer that will click on the video and how we can use language to appeal to them. So this will also vary based on the type of offer that we're running and you know kind of video title that we're running. So for example, if we're making a video about Google ads, we advertise a course for advertisers with over 10 plus years of experience.

 The hook will have a more sophisticated language, right? will be a little bit more complex. Maybe you can add a little bit more jargon because it's meant for advertisers with 10 years of experience. So, they've been doing it for 10 years. That's very specific. But if you're making a video about starting an online business, more targeted towards beginners, hook will have simpler language because your hook needs to align with your viewers title and thumbnail.

 So once again, title and thumbnail will attract a certain type of viewer and then the hook will appeal to this viewer, right? Right? So the first 5 seconds is to make it clear in the viewer's mind that they didn't get click baited and show you can actually meet the audience's expectations. So 10 different types of hooks, right? Number one, it's a question hook.

 Number two, it's a shocking statement. Number three is the storytelling hook. Number four is the preview hook. Number five, it's the personal connection. Number six is is the statistic or fact hook. Number seven is the challenge hook. Number eight is the quotation hook. Number nine is the metaphor hook.

 Number 10, it's the proof hook. Right? Just going to go back, take a screenshot of this, save this. Right, these are the 10 different types of hooks that I use in every video. And um yeah, if you just want these hook templates, um just click the link in the description. I'll send it right to your inbox.

 I'll have it within the workbook just so you can have access to all of this and you can write a banger hook on your own. Okay, so in terms of which one you should use, right, you have to understand that each hook has its own place depending on the context of the video. So, if you're struggling to figure out which hook to pick, choose the one that goes straight to the point, right? Because really, the simpler the hook, the more effective it is, right? Most people don't really talk about it, but the simpler the hook, the more effective it is. So, now that you know about all the hooks you can use, how do you actually write a good hook? So, let's talk about the four things a strong hook does. So, number one, it should confirm your viewers expectations. Number two, it should introduce curiosity. So, it should tease a story, solution, oral result. So, number three is set the stakes. So it's highlight why the viewers need to watch or make it very clear what the viewer will learn from the video. So that's setting expectations. And number four is to establish uniqueness. So it's to show why your content stands out. So for example, in this video, right, Alex Moy's $100 million code email strategy. This video it says he had 32K views. That's a that's an old screenshot. Right now it's I think it's about 300k views um in the tiny code email niche. So when

I look at the title, right, every time when I script a video, I I do this. I need to have the title before I write the script because once again title thumbnail sets expectations for the video and then um the hook will follow up from the title and thumbnail. So whenever I have a title the title will raise certain questions in the viewer's mind and I just want to outline these questions and I just want to answer them.

 That's literally it right? So it's how did Alex's code mill strategy make him $100 million? Right? This is code email strategy effective. Is it easy to implement this strategy? Can I use it to make money for my business? That's immediately what I think of when I see the title, right? Alex Mosy's $100 million code strategy.

 And then all I have to do is answer them, right? Answer all these questions that pop up in the viewer's mind. It's like handling handling objections before a sales call. Exact same thing. And if you can handle all of them before the sales call, the more likely they are to buy, right? Assuming you have a sales call, right? Um within your sales process or whether it's like um just leading them to a landing page, pretty much just need to answer all of these objections.

 In this case, we're selling them on watching the rest of the video. So, we get this hook, right? Humosi uses code outreach to generate zillions of leads across his portfolio companies without lifting a finger. And I read this before, so I'm not going to read it again. So, if you read this, right, and you can pause and read this, right? This hook answers all of the viewers questions that they have in mind, right? The first line says, "Alex uses code to generate zillions of leads." So, it answers, "How did Alex's coding email strategy make him $100 million?" This one, is his coding email strategy effective? I said that it's effective number one, right? I said, "I'll boil it down into four key steps so it's easy to follow." I said, "Okay, this is exact strategy." So once again, it answers, "Is this coding mill strategy effective? And is it easy to implement?" Right? Once again, I answered it. I'll boil it down to four key steps. So there are certain sentences that are like dual purpose that answers multiple questions in the viewer's mind and could I use it to make money for for my business, right? So it's like, oh, I spent the last week breaking down the strategy so you don't have to. Just like that. That's how you write a hook. Nothing nothing super complicated. Just answer the objections within the title. So you know how to write banger hooks. Let's go. So how do you actually write a good hook? I'm going to go through some hooks for the

most common types of YouTube videos, right? Educational and documentary. And let's start with educational videos. I'm just going to go over a couple examples kind of the logic and the thought process behind each line. Really, the hook is where you need to be the most particular about every single sentence because every sentence needs to have a purpose in the hook.

 If it doesn't have a purpose, if it doesn't add to, you know, getting the viewer across the line to watching the rest of the video, then you can probably cut it. So, this one one of my bigger videos, right? How Iman Gajgaji made $40 million from one YouTube video. First line based on the title, you can see listen up because Iman Gaji made $40 million from one YouTube video.

 Once again, just repeat the title, right? That's immediately validating the click. Nothing super complicated. And it works cuz it confirms the click and use it to buy his private jet. So once again, it builds intrigue, it builds stakes. Also, kind of during the time when um my video was posted, I bought a private jet, which is totally ridiculous by the way.

 So, um, so that also kind of adds to, uh, the intrigue there, right? It raises the stakes. Private Jet makes the viewer wonder if they could be that that successful, too. And it's also, um, kind of like a like a commentary or kind of like a trending topic uh, that I that I leveraged within the hook.

 And then the sixth line, and because I wanted the private jet 2, I spent three weeks slaving away at my computer to figure out how he did it. So, there's also like credentials here. Okay. I spent all this time learning about it. Um, it's also kind of joke. Oh, because I want to private jet, too.

 So, there's more of a personal connection there, right? Similar to the audience, bridging me, bridging the gap between them and mod. So, all you have to do is watch this video. So, I was like, hey, I spent three weeks studying it. So, all you have to do is watch this video. So, it teases a shortcut, right? So, it's like, hey, just watch this video.

 You'll get all of my expertise from the past 3 weeks. That's the function of this line. This line promises an irresistible value exchange. The viewer saves time and effort by watching the video instead of doing the hard work themselves. And then I also have this video, right, which is my full YouTube script writing course.

 I kind of want to break down this hook um because I think I did a little bit something a little bit more interesting here. So, this is uh like my most viewed video on my channel. So, number one is to relate vulnerability. So, the first line that I use is, "Hey, I don't know a whole lot about YouTube.

 I'm not that good at coming up with ideas. My thumbnails are okay, right? It's like, hey, admit my weaknesses, right?" Because most people who like kind of like start a course like, "Oh, I kind of know everything." But I'm like, "Hey, I don't know a whole lot about everything. I'm not that good at ideas.

 Not good at thumbnails." Right? So, I I admit my weaknesses, right? And I'm like, "Hey, but if there's one thing that I'm good at, it's how to write a great YouTube script." It's cuz like I'm a YouTube script writer. So, it's like uh kind of the thought process with this is like, "Hey, if you talk to a chef, you're not going to ask a chef how to like fix your fridge, right? Chef probably doesn't know how to fix the fridge, but you probably know how to cook a good steak, right?" So, it's kind of the same idea. Hey, I'm not that good at all these other things, but actually pretty good at this, right? So yeah, I I quickly establish um credibility, right? Go from vulnerability to authority, right? Establish myself as an expert. And really that's the first sentence. So it's like, hey, like I want to mention script writing within the very first line to immediately validate the click. And then I have more credibility here, right? In the past 9 months, I've written YouTube scripts 40 plus educational channels and help them gain millions of views and generate millions of dollars in revenue. Right? Quantifiable results, builds trust, give the viewer a reason to keep watching. books of channels like Instantly Ei, High Fury, Dave Forgetty, uh, and other channels with millions of subscribers,

right? Credibility, again, clear and aspirational payoff, right? You have everything that you need to write a script from start to finish in half the time and have your video perform better. Yep. Once again, a specific promise for what the audience will gain by watching the video and gives the viewers a strong reason to stick around.

 So, once again, there's that, right? And then this is another of my video, how Alex Mosie makes 100 million a year from YouTube. So, first line, right? Validate the click. once we want to validate the click, right? Alex Moszi has become one of the biggest creators in the business niche on YouTube, going from zero to 2 million subscribers in just four years.

So, credible figure why you should listen to this guy, but what is it that makes his videos go viral over and over again? So, here we want to create an open loop, create a question in the viewer's mind, right? So, this line builds curiosity. It's like, hey, rhetorical question, right? Physicians ask someone who has done the research.

 I spent the past 6 months watching all of Alex's content, long form and short form, to figure out what he's doing differently. So authority true effort, right? So this is called uh input bias, right? Where I've put in a large amount of time and in exchange, you just have to watch the short video to really understand it.

 So we emphasize the effort and time we spent on research. Most viewers wouldn't have time to do this. So I position myself as an expert with that very first line. If you just want to learn all of Hormosi's things, you just have to watch this video. Once again, input bias like this also a great way of establishing credibility.

 If the specific topic you haven't generated insane outsized results for, right? You if you actually spend the time like research, you can say it. And the big payoff is that it turns out he cracked the YouTube algorithm. So it's like this is more of like a benefit to the viewer. Okay, so if you crack the YouTube algorithm, if you watch this, you can also learn how to do that.

 So this means that our video includes Alex's secret that can transform the viewers approach to YouTube. There you go. Okay, one more video, right? This is another my video, how to make a killer YouTube video for the 2024 algorith. So, this is the very first video that I published and this video got like 20k views um within the first I think like 10 days or like 2 weeks.

 Um and it's what helped um take my channel off, right? Helped it gain its first 1,000 subscribers and uh it might be the first video that you ever watched with me. So, really the very first line, right, one killer YouTube video could completely change your life. Yes, this is aspirational opening, but it also validates the click, right? The title says make a killer YouTube video and here immediately I want to say hey killer YouTube video I say I say it in the first line and completely change your life is also a benefit right taps into what the audience wants broad enough to appeal to anyone interested in growing on YouTube right so super broad hook it can give you the momentum to go from zero to 100k subscribers in record-breaking time just like many other favorite creators right and once again there relatable examples yes uh but it's also the benefit right if you make a killer YouTube video and the logic follows, right? I say it completely change your life. The next line needs to explain, okay, why can it change your life? Cuz it can take you from zero to 100k subscribers. Makes the idea of one viral video feel more achievable. And once again, I've spent the past 5 months researching the biggest creators on this platform.

Credibility again. And in this video, I'm going to reveal is reveal spelled wrongly. How to make a YouTube video that will blow up your channel. And it all comes down to five simple steps, right? That's setting clear expectations for what the viewer will get, right? So, it's having a clear value proposition.

And yeah, those are my best hooks kind of like broken down and pretty much that's everything that you need to know about hooks and also kind of showed you, you know, mistakes that people make in their hooks. And yeah, that's pretty much everything that you need to know about writing hooks.

 And once again, remember the common hook mistakes you can make, right? The jargon, the fluff, the credentials, and let's break down a couple other elements to write a good hook, right? It's the confirming expectations, it's introducing curiosity, it's setting stakes, it's establishing uniqueness, right? We need these four components in every good hook. So what's next? Start practicing.

Write as write as much as you can. Study what works and yeah eventually you'll be able to write great hooks. So also like a great way of writing hooks. So once again when I explained in the research module it's modeling hooks that have worked right when you start modeling what's working eventually you'll get a good sense and you have a good feeling for really what's performing really well.

 So, right now, let's switch screens. Let's transition to showing you how I write hooks and yeah, so I can kind of explain my thought process a little bit live and you can take a thing or two away from that. Let's go. So, I've taken some of these scripts and some of these titles from members within the YouTube script writing academy.

 They just send these in for review and um I review them. you know, some of these I've already I've already kind of like looked at a little bit, but I want to rewrite these hooks from scratch so you can kind of see um the you know, the main different ways that I think about it.

 So, here he's outlined it a little bit, right? Goals video is about 10 minutes, 2,000 words, right? Learn how to get clients with quality code outreach, right? Hook, pre-qualified, the top five methods, school, LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, Discord, right? FE free value outreach. Good. Okay. How to land your first copyrightiting client. So instantly right when I think about this right the questions from this okay how do I do it what frameworks do you have um who are you why should I listen to you um what else how much will my first client pay me right so these They're just like immediate questions that that come to mind. So let's see. So really with the first line, right, the framework that we want to use is like immediately validate the click, right? Create curiosity and then um we want to establish credibility too and then set the stakes,

right? Establish credibility or establish uniqueness, right? That I discussed in the framework. And also like set the stakes and sometimes this can be jumbled up a little bit, but let's just see. Okay, let let's immediately validate the click, right? So, this is like a simple how-to. So, in this video, I'm going to reveal to you, I'm going to reveal how to land your first copyrightiting client even if you have no experience.

 This is the exact framework that I've used to go from being a broke college student to landing my very my first client and now scaling up to making my first 50k a month. All true copywriting, right? So, this is kind of like credibility a little bit but also like curiosity. Um, but then you can also be like, "Oh, I've tested um all of the all of the I've tested every client acquisition method under the sun, including um Instagram DMs, code email, um creating content, and What I'm about to show you is by far the most effective method.

You can see here, establish credibility, right? True timing. I tested all of these. My promise to you is that if you watch till the end, you and you actually implement this information for the next seven days. Yo, guaranteed land a client, right? Of course, we need to be uh careful about the claims that we make, right? Um but also like depending on the actual content that you talk about within the video, this could actually be okay to say, right? If you give like a specific protocol to follow or if you're like, "Hey, like we have like an accountability group. You like click the link in the description." Now, these are certain claims that you can make. Um obviously, I need a little bit more context on the actual content of the video, but this is just me writing the hook based off seeing the title, right? Some of these are like just like

made up. I I I don't know the actual client, but but um you can see like here you're pretty much using the framework and you have a whole hook based on that written in I don't know maybe that took like 2 minutes. I I I don't even know. So previously we were looking at how to escape the rat race.

 Now let's have a look at how to write a hook. So once again one of the things that you want to look at when you're writing your hook, right? One of the things that I'm pretty good at is just like spawning hooks out of thin air. kind of like looking at the frameworks, but that's because I've also written so many hooks.

 I know what's working and I kind of have like a database in the back of my mind. So, what I would do if I were writing hooks and I wasn't super familiar once again, I would look at my hook swipe file, right? So, if if there's like any hooks that are like really good, you know, that you really um that you've watched the videos and you're like, "Hey, that hook is really good.

" Keep in a swipe file, right? It's basically a database of all of your favorite hooks. and then um you can just write based off of that. Uh so that's number one thing that I would do. Number two, I would also look at competitors um within the niche, right? That's part of the research. Look at what hooks that they are using.

 So maybe we can watch this video for a little bit and we can see business find me and many other skilled creators on Fiverr or you for years I felt trapped on a relentless treadmill stuck in the grind working for someone else and allowing my job to define my entire identity. I have become con Okay, so she says uh for years I was stuck in the rat race and we can also kind of have a look at the transcript here.

 We don't have to make our lives super difficult, right? For years I felt trapped on a runless treadmill, stuck in the grind working for someone else and allowing my job to define my entire identity convinced that the only path to freedom was to quit the 9-5 rat race. But after working well after spending so long working for an organization and now also having seen the other side and experienced what it's like to work for yourself, I've now realized the real issue wasn't my job. It was me. So in this video, I wanted to share some of the hidden secrets that I've learned that can help you break free. So here, if we break it down into its base parts, right? Instead of like copying it word forward and like modifying word forward, which is definitely not what you want to do, you can have a look at this. Okay, for years I felt trapped in a relentless treadmill. So she immediately validates the click, which is great. And she also starts with a personal story, right? So, and then uh pretty much what you want to do is you want to do this for all the other videos and kind of see if there's anything um just anything interesting that they did in their hook. So, like let's maybe look at one more. So, this like the Dan Co video, escape wage slavery. It's not the exact same thing, but it's close enough. So, let's see what he did in this hook. If you clicked on this video without getting offended

by the title, then great job. If you're offended by the title, then you probably won't get anything from this video. You're not super helpful, right? Cuz he has slavery in the title, so we can't really um emulate that. Let's just think how how we would ride this on our own. So how to skip the rad race.

So we want to immediately validate the click. Let me just make this a little bit bigger. So whenever I write a script, I always want to have this as the headline at the top. So this will always remind me on the actual title of the video. So once again, let me double check what the actual title is and how to skip the rat race while cleaning your 95.

 So let's write the hook. Let's see what we come up with. So, we're doing all this live. I don't even know what we what we're going to come up with. Okay. So, once again, we want to immediately validate the click of the title and then uh we want to create curiosity or create an open loop. We want to establish credibility and then um set uh set set the set expectations, right? Or what the payoffs is or set the stakes, right? There's a couple different ways people have phrased it, but um yeah, so like let's see how to escape the rat race without quitting your 9 to5. So um what Misha did um was there's kind of like the story behind, you know, being trapped financially uh or like being trapped in a job feeling like she was on the treadmill. It's more of like a personal story. Uh another way that we can do it is that we can also like directly address the viewer. So, it's like, hey, I know what it's like.

I know what it's like being stuck at a job that you hate, right? You feel like you're this. You feel like you're that. But let me tell you, but let me tell you something. Being a job doesn't have to be the end of the world, right? Um, that's also like one angle that we can the one angle that we can take.

 And but that's just the one that came off the top of my head. Um, so let's let's maybe lead with that. So like let's see what we can come up with that and then maybe if you want we can write a couple variations based on that. So I know what it's like being stuck at a 9 to5 job that um that you hate.

Feels like you're stuck. You're stuck on a treadmill. It feels like you're stuck on a treadmill that you can't afford to step off. It feels like you're stuck on a treadmill that you can't afford to step off. And if you do, you get judged by your friends and family or even worse, you may lose may lose your house.

 That's not super strong. But and if you do, you get judged by your friends and family. And if you do, you get judged you by your friends and family. Okay, this this line isn't super strong. Feels like you're stuck on a treadmill that you can't afford to step off. And if you're watching this video, you're likely dying.

to learn how to reach finan how to achieve financial freedom. I've personally started I personally started multiple businesses that I've grown to multi7 multi7 figures and some to the $100 million range. And along the way, I've helped countless of you escape the rat race, too. And along the way, I've helped

Tens of thousands of people escape quit their 9 to5 the right way and yes it's not about quitting their 9 to5 along the way I've helped Tens of thousands of people escape the rat race without taking on tons of risk by quitting their 9 to5. You can see here kind of established credibility, right? I've I've grown all these businesses, helped tens of thousands of people.

 I think that's good. In this video, I want I'm going to I'm going to walk you through. What am I going to walk you through? The four principles that once you understand that once you inter on once you un once you internalize and implement into your life daily will help you reach financial will help you finally achieve financial freedom.

 Now, this is a little bit long, right? I know what it's like being stuck at a 9 to5 job you hate. It feels like you're stuck on a treadmill that you can't afford to step off and everyone. But it feels like if you want to escape the rat race, but it's but it feels like everyone is telling you that if you want to escape the rat race, you have to quit your 9 to5 and take on large amounts of risk.

That is simply not true. Right? So here I'm kind of like more getting getting closer to the title. Let me make this smaller so you guys can see this all in one page. Maybe that's helpful. I know what it's like being stuck in a 9 toive job that you hate, right? It feels like you're stuck on a treadmill that you can't afford to step off, but it feels like feels like you're stuck on a treadmill that you can't afford to step off.

 But it feels like everyone is telling you that if you want to skip the rat race, you have to quit your 9 to5, take on large amounts of risk. That is simply not true. I've personally started multiple businesses. I've grown to multi-7 figures and some to the $100 million range. And along the way, I've helped tens of thousands of people escape the rat race without taking on here. Here we repeat tons of risk.

 So I don't want to do that. So now I'm kind of in the stage of just refining it, right? And as you can see, I'm not just like quietly sitting here. This is actually what I do. I actually read out the script and you can see when I'm reading out the script, it's a lot more obvious what the mistakes are.

 So here I can say I say risk twice in the same sentence. Uh which isn't super great. So we really just want to edit and like refine this. I've helped tens of thousands of people escape the rat race. And yes, there is a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it. In this video, I'm going to walk you through the to four principles that once you internalize and implement in your life daily will help you finally achieve financial freedom. So, let's see.

 Again, I know what it's like being stuck at a 9 to5 job you hate. Feels like you're stuck on a treadmill that you can't afford to step off. But it feels like everyone is telling you that if you want to escape the rat race. So, it's like here I say like I I know what it's like being stuck at a 9 to5 job.

 It feels like you stuck a treadmill. You can't afford the staff off. It sucks. But if you want to escape the rat race, so here I'm just going to trim it a lot. If you want to escape the rat race, you don't have to quit your 9 to5. Contrary contrary to popular belief, you don't. You have to quit your 9 to5 and take on large amounts of risk.

 I've really started multiple businesses that that I've grown to multi-7 figures and some to the hundred million dollar range. And along the way, I've helped tens of thousands of people escape the rat race ways rat race the right way. And yes, there is a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it. All right.

 In this video, I'm going to walk you through the four principles that once you internalize and implement into your life daily and implemented into your daily life will help you finally achieve financial freedom. And here we have the transition. There you go. So, that's a hook.

 Kind of like spawned it out of thin air. Uh let me know what you guys think. Um, I I think I think this is like a pretty good base to start off, but um really when you're writing a hook, you want to spend a lot more time on it. You want to write a couple variations of it, right? But this is just like the first line that I came up with that came off the top of my head.

And here you can kind of see like me refining it, me reading it, me um me editing it, and this is pretty much the attention of level uh attention to detail that you need and that it takes to write a great hook. So hopefully hopefully this was helpful. And yeah, now that we've written a great hook, next step is we want to learn how to write the payoff.

 So the actual meat and body of the content. So in the research stage, we talked about how to pick the payoffs and now we're going to talk about how to actually write the payoffs and bring it to life. So let's get into that. Okay, let's talk a little bit about payoffs. I think payoffs or like the points that you talk about within your script is one of the more interesting things that we look at when we're making YouTube videos because it's the actual bulk of your content.

 And I almost find it pretty interesting that, you know, everyone focuses on the hook. Everyone focuses on the call to action, really everything around making great content, but no one actually talks about how to create strong payoffs and how to create emotional payoffs, like payoffs that bring out emotion or payoffs that's actually valuable to the viewer.

 And that's exactly what I want to break down today. I think I've got some good sauce on this. So, sit down and uh take some notes. If you haven't already been taking notes, time to take some notes because we've gone over research, we've gone over hooks. Now, we're going to go over how to actually write the meat of the content and how I really think about, you know, do I review the payoff early? Do I review the payoff a little bit late? How do you set it all up? We'll talk about all of that. So, before we even go into explaining how to write a payoff, we first have to understand what are payoffs. So a payoff is the moment in a script when you reward the audience for sticking around. So think of a payoff as answering the question, why did I watch this? So the payoff could be, you know, in section one, right at the end when we give them the reward, that would be considered a payoff. Or when you watch the video from start to finish and there's like a satisfying end and there's like an emotional payoff. You feel good after watching it. That's the mega payoff. What I would consider the mega payoff of

the video. So what why do payoffs matter? Because payoffs make your audience feel satisfied. So if you're watching a movie that sets up a big mystery that never explains it feels frustrating, right? Payoffs prevent that frustration and they make the audience feel that their time was well spent or you know in this case it would be like a dopamine hit, right? For example, in a murder mystery, the payoff is to find out who the killer is.

 And without answering who the killer is, the story feels incomplete. It feels like you're being cheated because there's no dopamine payoff. Payoffs can be emotional or informational, right? It can be either of the two. Doesn't really matter. And you have to make the audience feel that everything they've watched so far was building up to this moment.

 So what? Because that keeps them watching. And when your viewers watch, right, watch time goes up, retention goes up, and views and revenue go up, which is which is all good for you. In this guide, we're going to break down how to set up, build, and deliver payoffs step by step. And by the end, you'll know how to use payoffs to keep your audience hooked from start to finish. So, let's get into it. Right.

We're going to cover payoffs and setups, the two different types of payoffs, earning a payoff, timing your payoff, avoiding common mistakes when you're scripting out your payoff, and then testing your payoff. So, making sure that the payoff is actually good. We're going to go over these six things.

 So, payoffs and setups. Every payoff needs a setup. And a setup is a clue, hint, or a piece of information that prepares the audience for what's coming. Without a setup, a payoff simply feels random. So, if a magician pulled a rabbit out of a hat without showing the hat first, it'd feel confusing.

 The magician needs to set up the expectation by showing the empty hat first. When the audience m when the magic trick comes, your audience gets the payoff that they've been waiting for. So, the setup is that important. So, setups create a sense of curiosity. They make the audience invested. It gives them context. It creates tension in the audience that they are compelled to want to resolve and the only way to resolve it is by watching till the end of the video.

 So when the payoff finally comes, they feel relief. They feel like they earned something and the payoff is made more impactful in their subjective experience and it feels like they're being rewarded for watching your video. So for example, in the movie Czechov's Gun, Czechov's Gun is a popular uh storytelling term, right? Or or screenwriting term, right? A character notices a gun hanging on the wall in act one.

 So that would be considered the setup. So in act three the gun is used in a dramatic scene and that's the payoff. So check gun basically says that if in a movie there's a gun, right, the gun needs to fire eventually. So anything anytime you set up something there needs to be a payoff. So you don't just want to introduce random pieces of information, random pieces of story uh that isn't super relevant.

 Every piece of the story that you have needs to get paid off, right? If kind of uh you're making a storytelling video, you know, there must be a reason that you set the story up in Brazil versus the US, right? There's a certain feel that you want to have. You don't just randomly pick a country that you want to set it up, set up the story in.

 There must be a reason why you create a certain form of setup. There's a reason why you give something a certain context, right? So that's the idea of checkoff scan. And this is applicable for YouTube too, right? You don't just want to set up a random point that you're going to talk about and then you never fully explain it.

 Everything in your script serves a purpose. Right? In your hook, we discussed it. Every line serves a purpose. Within the script, if we were to script the script super strictly and, you know, be super specific of what words we use and, you know, how the viewer interprets it, then every single word we speak matters. Everything that we set up matters.

 Every check gun we decide to set up matters in delivering the most amount value per minute. So you can use this exact same principle in a YouTube video. So let's look at an example. So in this video right the terrifying ghost town hounds of deep apalakia. This is how the video starts.

 Apalakia dot dot dot the landed internet has made famous for its legends its entities and its lore. So I would consider this the setup right. So it instantly sets up Apalakia's ghost towns as something mysterious. So once again, the internet has made famous for its legends, its entities, and its lore. It makes the viewer slowly grow more and more curious because we created the setup.

 So the payoff all the way at the end is follow me as I journey through these places with nothing but myself and the camera and explore these empty ghost towns. You'll get the full behind-the-scenes view of what they look like in the modern day. And then you want to make sure that in the video you actually show that.

 So the setup is I'm curious about Apalakian ghost towns. And the payoff is I will continue watching the video to learn more about Apalakian ghost towns. So like the payoff is like the entire video basically. So your goal with every payoff is to keep the viewer watching until the end. Like that's kind of the point of every single video, right? And you can do that by understanding the different payoffs that you can use, right? And really there are two main payoffs, right? Different types of payoffs uh you'll choose depending on the goal of your scripts. So here are the most common. Number one is the emotional payoff. So you want to make the audience feel something like joy, sadness, relief, fear, and this the best payoff that you can use in emotional or documentary videos. So for example, this video by Gaji, right, surprising my mom with a $4 million dream house. The entire video setup is how he built a successful business. And at the end, the payoff is the clip where he finally brings his mom to her new dream house. So that's the emotional payoff. And then there's the informational payoff, which reveals something that the audience wanted to know. So, this works for both documentary and educational videos. So,

this is a pretty pretty standard educational video. Five steps to make $10,000 a month rising online. This talking head video, right? This video has five setups. And for each step, the goal of each setup is to keep the viewer watching until the end of the step. And from there, the payoff will transition into the next steps payoff, building on the information that's shared with every step.

 So, very clearly from the title, you can see it's five steps. And so there's five different payoffs and every single payoff needs to build on the next. So that way there's a reason for the viewer to watch payoff one go to payoff two goes to payoff three goes to payoff four goes to payoff five. It needs to be a buildup in terms of the importance of the payoff.

 And then kind of the whole mega payoff of the video is how to make 10K a month writing online. So each type serves a different purpose but all payoffs need to feel earned. So, we'll cover how to earn a payoff in the next section because you don't just want to give it away. Like the reason running a marathon feels so good is because you spend all this time training and you actually run the marathon, right? That's why there's that huge dopamine hit.

 If I tell you to sprint for 20 seconds, there there isn't actually a dopamine hit, right? Because you don't really earn the payoff. And this exact same thinking needs to be applied to a YouTube video. You don't just want to give the payoff um without any investment, right? If you give the view a payoff without investment, that's when they're not super invested in your brand.

 They're not super invested in your channel. Yes, you may get a lot of views, but you don't really build that depth with your audience. And that's the that's the one thing that we want to do. So, earning a payoff, a payoff feels earned when it's believable and well prepared. If a payoff comes out of nowhere, the audience feels kind of confused.

 So, they don't understand why they should care about the payoff. So more important than the payoff is the setup, right? Because the setup will tell the viewer, hey, this is why you should care about the payoff. They don't really know why they care. Then they won't really care. Unsatisfied.

 So they don't care about the payoff. So it doesn't matter to them or they bored, right? They don't feel excited to learn or to see the payoff. So if you want to avoid, you know, them being bored, unsatisfied, confused, I would number one, plant clear setups, right? If nobody's going to understand your setup, then no one's going to care about your setup.

 It has to be very clear why someone should care about the setup. So, it needs to be clear. It needs to be simple. So, simple language and use clear visuals to set up the payoff. So, an example of a bad setup is, hey, in this video, I'm going to show you what to feed your dog, right? The setup doesn't really work because it doesn't answer the why.

 Like, why should the viewer care about what they feed their dogs? So, there needs to be a setup there. And number two, it's to make it logical, right? So, this is a really important tip that I see script writers always forget about. And whatever they do, it makes their payoffs feel confusing and make it difficult to understand. Right? If it's not logical.

So let me break down fully what I mean by making your payoffs logical. It means there should be a logical progression between your setup and payoff. So here's an example. So if you say that there are hundreds of ways to make money online, but SMAS are still the easiest, most effective way to grow an online business.

 Does the logic flow or does it not flow? Right? The logic doesn't really make sense. Let me break down why it doesn't make sense. So, I say that there are hundreds of ways to make money online, but I don't explain any of these. And then I just throw out the claim that, hey, SMAS are the easiest, most effective way to grow an online business.

 So, we don't really explain that. So, here we're kind of just throwing out claims here. Oh, there's hundreds of ways. Oh, it's the easiest way. We don't fully fully explain it. So, there's really like a gap in the logic here. It's like, okay, whenever we make a claim in the payoff, we need to substantiate it, right? A lot of the big common mistakes when writing payoffs is just injecting more payoffs within the payoff and you don't fully explain a point.

 But really, if you want someone to understand it, you need to fully, you know, break it down and the logic needs to flow well, right? For example, if you read a book and the logic didn't flow well, right? Or the story logic didn't flow well. Say you're reading a pretty shitty book, it's going to be difficult to follow, right? You're not going to want to read it.

 And the same thing happens with a YouTube video. If the logic doesn't flow from sentence to sentence, it's going to be very, very, very difficult to follow. So, you want to think about the logic, right? You want to think about the consequence. As I said, line one should lead to line two should lead to line three.

 Aka, that means there needs to be a clear logical flow. If there's no clear logical flow, it's very difficult to watch your video. Okay? So, here's the fixed versions, right? So if I say that there are hundreds of ways to make money online from Amazon FBA, digital products, etc. All of which require tons of marketing knowledge, a big ad budget and more.

 But SMMA is still the easiest to start from zero without a budget and it allows you to scale to six figures easily. Ah, so there's context. Okay, there's hundreds of ways to do it, right? Hundreds of ways to do it. But there's all of these problems with it. But with SMMA, you can do this.

 SMMA is social media marketing agency. It's a business model just for some context. So you can see here the logic is already much smoother. The viewers flow of logic will be okay you go from the setup right the business models have all these downsides to the payoff which I can start an SMMA it won't have any of those downsides and yeah we can easily transition to a new setup after setup one right which is hey SMA is the best business model so how do you start as an SMMA? So really transition from payoff one to payoff two setup one to setup two. So the more effort you put into earning a payoff, the more impactful it will be. And in order to write impactful payoffs, you need to understand timing because timing is everything, right? When you deliver a payoff too early, it loses impact. But if you deliver it too late and you set up setup setup and actually the setup's kind of boring, then the audience will lose interest. So really, when you're writing a script, you need to time the payoff perfectly. A good rule of thumb is to build up to the payoff gradually. So you want to use smaller moments to keep the audience engaged or they wait for the big payoff which is the mega

payoff. So if we go back to SMMA example right the payoff saying that SMAS are the best business model right you can say that SMAS have fewer downsides and then you can transition to SMAs can be set up easily which is the second payoff and then finally you pay off common mistakes in SMMA so you can cover all of these different points um these are all considered payoffs.

 So we slowly build out our payoffs um to you know kind of the mega payoff being smas are the best business model until your audience understands the main or what I call the mega payoff. Spacing out these moments keeps the audience interested while building anticipation for the final reveal. So you can see here it's a buildup.

 See kind of like the circle is like the importance of each payoff. So there's like a buildup saying that hey one is more important than the other which is exactly what you want to achieve in your script. But timing your payoffs wrong are one of the most common mistakes I see script writers make. Right? Alongside that, there are a few more mistakes that you need to avoid when writing your payoff.

 So, let's look at a couple common mistakes, right? Avoiding mistakes with payoffs can save your script from feeling confusing or unsatisfying. So, let's break down the common pitfalls and how to specifically avoid them. Overloading the script, right? When you include too many payoffs in your script, it might sound exciting, but it can leave your audience overwhelmed.

 You definitely don't want to leave your audience overwhelmed. So, each payoff needs time to breathe. And if you stack too many, they'll start to blur together. So a a good example of overloading your audience is when you introduce two payoffs within 5 minutes. That is simply too much information to process, right? Especially if it's a highly educational video, you need to give your audience time to breathe, right? You need to give your audience time to process your information.

 That's where um your speaking speed comes in. If you speak way too fast, you go blah blah blah blah blah, very difficult to understand what you're actually trying to say. So that will also impact your payoff delivery. So that's kind of like the delivery of the script, right? Or you know, especially if you try to chunk down, say too many things in a short amount of time, very difficult to follow because you won't have time to fully explain it, right? So the solution is to focus on a few key payoffs and spread them out logically throughout the video. And then underwhelming payoffs. An underwhelming payoff happens when the result doesn't live up to the buildup. If you spend half your script building suspense but deliver a predictable or weak conclusion, the audience feels let down. Example of underwhelming. So a long explanation on the best email writing framework that ends in a 5-second tutorial. So if you explain the full framework, long explanation and the tutorial short 5 seconds is kind of exaggerated, but let's say it's like 20 30 seconds and you don't fully pay off the setup, right? So you build up all this dopamine and then there's like a big crash that leads to terrible viewer satisfaction. So your video may get a

huge bump in initial views because people watch the first the first part, but then there's a huge crash because your advice is terrible. So there's like no point in that retention. You'll see very clearly you go like this and then there's a huge dip and then you're kind of screw it from there.

 Like like what's the reason I'm doing that? No reason to not pay something off properly. So you want to match the payoff scale to the setup. So if the buildup is intense, make the payoff equally impactful. Another mistake is forgetting the setup, right? So a payoff without a setup feels random and out of place.

 The audience will think where did that come from? So you just randomly bring up a point aka you break the logic chain uh you introduce too many payoffs right all these problems are kind of interconnected that's when you really confuse the audience and the payoff isn't super strong because you randomly bring out a payoff that's not connected to the logic of the other payoffs.

 So that's one of the things you want to think about too. So we already explained this earlier in the logic section. You always remember to refer to the sub setup when you're writing the payoff. Most of the time you can easily avoid these mistakes by testing your payoffs after you write them.

 So here's how you can start testing your payoffs to know if they're banners. So this is how I kind of think about testing payoff. So number one, you want to read it out loud. So sometimes just hearing your words can reveal if your payoff is working. So you want to read the setup and the payoff together out loud. And then when you're reading out loud, ask yourself, does the payoff logically follow the setup? And does it feel satisfying or does it fall flat? So kind of just now I was reading out loud the hook that I wrote and kind of the hook. If you take that as any piece of writing or as a payoff, you can see when I read it out loud, I could see, okay, where is there like a break in logic, right? And that's something that as a viewer while you were watching me write it, you might have seen, okay, there's a break in logic. But uh that's because you're watching from uh like a third person perspective. When I read it out loud, I put myself in that third person's perspective and see my script as something that, you know, I'm not writing and can immediately see the mistakes a lot easier when I'm reading it out loud. And it's something that I would have never caught if I didn't read it out loud. So, sounds kind of dumb, but obviously if you're in your room, right, and you're writing a script and

you can read the script out loud, right? If you're in a cafe, like kind of like whisper it to yourself or whatever, but you need to read your script out loud because eventually, right, whether you or your client's going to sit in the chair, get in front of the camera, and they're going to read it out loud, right? And they're going to spot mistakes that you don't if you don't read it out loud.

 So, you have to read it out loud before you get in front of the camera. It's good practice, right? If you're the one writing your own scripts, it's good practice to sit down here so you can actually learn how to do it yourself. Number two, review timing and pacing. Delivering the payoff early or too late can ruin its impact.

 So, you want to watch out for, right, delivering it too early, that means that the audience hasn't had time to anticipate, you know, kind of when the payoff will come or it's too late, right? Um the audience will lose interest and forget the setup. So, you want to have your payoff timed perfectly, not too early, not too late.

 And um kind of as a benchmark, right, you want to keep your sections at 300 to 500 words. So payoffs around 300 to 500 words. And um any longer and your viewers will uh forget the first setup. And really, if you feel like, hey, right, my payoff section needs to be longer. It's, you know, needs to be 700 to a,000 words.

 700 to 1,000 words. 1,000 words is about uh like a five minute 5 minutes long, right? And attention spans are a little lower. So within that 1,000 words, if you're scripting it out, usually there's a way to cut it in half. Maybe you are giving too much yap, you're talking too much or within that there's a mini payoff that you can have, right? So you want to identify that and also add a setup there if that makes sense.

 And number three, revise the payoffs based on feedback. So if multiple people are giving you similar feedback, it's a sign that something needs fixing. So don't ignore it, right? You want to adjust your setup, build up or pay off accordingly. So for example, if three people say, "Right, ending felt rushed in a documentary video.

 expand the scenes leading to the payoff, then you want to do just that, right? You want to take time to refine your payoffs and your audience will thank you by staying hooked until the very last scene, right? If your payoffs are done really well, that's when your average view duration on your video is just substantially higher.

 So you want to spend time making the video as valuable as possible, you know, creating strong setups, strong payoffs, so that, you know, when the viewer watches it from start to finish, it's actually a good piece of content that they would want to share with their friends. And yeah, that's basically how to write the payoff.

 Now, I want to do a little bit of script writing live where I will expand um the very first payoff on how to escape the rat race without quitting your 9 to5 and do it live and show you my exact thought process. Really, when we're writing a single payoff, focus on the setup and also focus on the logic, right? As I explained, the logic needs to flow from setup to payoff.

 So, I'm just going to like write it out loud so you can kind of see the thought process and hopefully we can come to something that we're decently happy with. Okay, let's go. So, we left off if with in this video I'm going to walk you through the four principles that once you internalize and implement into your daily life will help you finally achieve financial freedom and then we have a transition here.

Right? Oh, the problem that most people face is that they think, but before you even think about quitting the rat race, you need to completely shift your frame about quitting your 9 to5. Having a 9-to-f5 isn't necessarily a nineto-5 doesn't have to be jail. Doesn't have to feel like jail, right? In fact, some of the biggest entrepreneurs started off as office workers, right? and eventually they decided to

quit and start their own business for example blah blah blah right uh I'm not can't think of an entrepreneur like uh was started off at like a 9 to5 but yeah here I will like do research for an example But that doesn't mean that you can sit comfortably at your 9 to5 um and hope that some miracle happens to you.

You need to be intentional about why you're in your 9 to5 in the first place. Your 9 to5 could be a job that is a stepping stone for you starting your business. So that could mean that you are learning high paying high value skills while you're at your job. Or the job could or you could just have the job or if you're not learning any skills.

At the very least, you should set the intention of being at the job to stack up your bankroll so that when you eventually quit, you have um money to lean back on. So, you can kind of see the logic here, right? or you don't want to sly at your 9 to5. You need to be intentional, right? That's kind of like the idea that I'm setting up here.

 You have money to um it's not money to lean back on. It's uh it's so that you have so that you have run away until you actually until you make enough money to pay your bills from your own business. Either ways, you must think of your 9 to5 as an opportunity rather than a um rather than a trap. Because when when you think about your job as an opportunity to learn to learn new skills or to make money in the meantime that will help you

make better decisions. at your job and still keep the option for you and and will help you make better better decisions at your job and play the long game. So here we want to give it a So if at your job you're learning how to run Facebook ads for business for businesses so that you can eventually go out on your own and run ads and so you can go on your own and start an agency.

That is a great reason to stick to your job. that that is that is a great reason to stick to your job. That is that is a great reason to stick your job. But if you're just coasting, if you're just going to your job, doing mundane tasks as an accountant and you're not learning anything high value, you need to spend your time outside of the office, in between breaks, or when your boss isn't watching to learn to pick up a high income skill.

And here I wrote this here, right? Because the only thing that differentiates those in the rat race and entrepreneurs and successful entrepreneurs is the skills that they have. If Elon Musk went bankrupt tomorrow, he would have a million dollars within a week. So that's why I want to give you the skills.

 That's why I want to give you the tools to learn the skills that number one is something I want to give you the tools to learn the skills that solves real world problems so that you can so that one day when you so choose you can quit your job and go all in on your own business. Something along these lines.

 I think I think this could be this could be pretty interesting. So, let me just have a look at the word count. And then uh I'm not going to edit this just yet. Right. So, 286 words. 286 to 500 words is kind of the length of a single payoff, right? Um as we said. So, yeah, like this is kind of like high level, right? You can see kind of the logic flows here of how I just like wrote something from scratch, right? You need to completely shift your frame.

 So, this is kind of open loop. We'll talk about that next. How to write transitions, right? But it doesn't have to feel like jail, right? Most started off as entrepreneurs uh start off as office workers. So, here if I need an example, right? I can go here and ask cla what successful entrepreneurs started off as 9-to-f5 workers.

 I am making a video on how to escape the rat race um without quitting your 9 to5. So really, if you don't have examples off the top of your head, use Claude, use Travt. Um, no one really uses Google anymore, but these are all like pretty easy ways. So here, Sarah Blakeley. Um, here, can you give me billionaires who are popular? Right? So the reason I say, can you give me billionaires who are popular is because if you watch videos, right, you'll notice that a lot of the examples that he uses is actually like billionaires. So you can see here, there you go. right here. There's a bunch of examples, right? Like don't have to pick one. Um maybe like Jeff Bezos would probably be um be the easiest example. But yeah, like let's just say let's just use Jeff Bezos, right? For example, Jeff Bezos worked as a financial analyst.

He was the youngest VP before leaving to start Amazon in his garage in 1994. But what Bezos didn't do is sit on his ass waiting for a miracle to happen to him. And neither should you. Right? So you can kind of see here I'm connecting the dots here. And yeah, you you know read through this again, go through rounds of editing until you actually like come up with something good.

 But like this is like a pretty good first draft that you're able to write, right? if you like really follow the logic and you can kind of see me editing it here. We can expand on like this is like more of like the how the how to do it, right? You can expand on this a little bit more, but I think this is like a pretty pretty damn good start.

But yeah, this is how to write a payoff. But once you have the payoff, the next important part is how to write an open loop. Aka once you have payoff one, two, three, you need to connect these in some way, right? There needs to be a transition and the transition is the open loop and the open loop is also a big part of the setup, right? It's where you like build up.

 Hey, right, this is the payoff and this is like really big. This is really important. So, that's the next thing that I want to cover. It's how to write an open loop. And let's go back to the slides. [Music] This is one of the most requested topics u for me to break down terms of how to write transitions and and yes background colors changed and yes my shirt has changed because it's a new day and uh recording this new module.

 I can't record 7 hours worth of modules. How long this video will be in one day. So we're breaking it up. Okay, let's talk about open loops. So ever notice how Netflix keeps you binge watching episode after episode? That's by design. And they use a psychological trick called open loops.

 And once I learned using open loops in my YouTube scripts, my AVD jumped by 5%. And you know, 5% doesn't seem like much. It actually is quite a bit, right? So, I'm going to go through everything that you need to learn about open loops and writing transitions. I'm going to go over what they are, why you need them, the common mistakes I see most script writers make when writing open loops, how to fix those mistakes and write better open loops, and the best way to learn open loops.

 So, I'm going to go over these four things. So, what are open loops and why do you need them? So, have you ever watched a Netflix show that ended an episode with a cliffhanger? Right? You had to know what happened next, so you clicked next episode. That's an open loop in action, right? And an open loop is a storytelling technique that creates curiosity by leaving a question or situation unresolved.

 So when you create a gap like that that leads to a dopamine spike in the viewer because they need to find out more. They need to find out more. They need to find out more. It's kind of like if your friend told you, "Hey, did you know what happened to Becky? Like did I tell you what happened to Becky?" And uh you're like, "No.

" And she's like, "Oh, never mind. Never mind. I don't I don't want to tell you." Right? That's called an open loop, right? So you can uh go up to your friends and you can freaking open loop them, right? Uh one one of the things that you can do to create a curiosity gap that you know really like pulls the viewer in.

 It's also a great way to do storytelling, right? That's why it's important to understand how to write these open loops. So when done right, open loops keep viewers watching because they want the answer, right? And it boosts engagement because people uh stay for the payoff, creates retention because unresolved curiosity keeps them glued to the content.

 This is stuff you guys know, right? And this technique is used in movies, TV shows, books, and especially in YouTube videos. YouTube rewards videos that keep viewers watching. So the longer someone stays on your video, the more likely the algorithm is to recommend it to others. That's really the core function of open loops.

 It's to get people bought in, right? And you could consider it the setup that we learned the payoff, right? Open loops is the setup and then there's kind of a buildup and then you pay it off afterwards, right? Good open loops, better retention, more views. Simple as that, right? And because open loops create anticipation, viewers don't click away, right? They give viewers a reason to stay until the end.

 And they make your video feel structured and engaging which improves the overall perceived quality, right? Because really when you follow, you know, like a script structure open loop and payoff, open loop, payoff, open loop, payoff. I I think that makes your video a lot more uh easily digestible. And without open loops, your audience has no reason to stay watching.

 Uh but really, when I first started writing scripts, I made tons of mistakes when I was writing open loops. So, I'm going to go over a couple of these mistakes. And I see literally a bunch of new script writers, bunch of business owners, bunch of YouTube creators doing the exact same mistake with these open loops.

 So yeah, I'm going to go over every single mistake so that you can avoid them or you can fix them. Mistake number one is being too vague. When your open loop is unclear, your audience won't know what they're waiting for. So this creates confusion, not curiosity, right? Your open loop needs to be written super clearly.

 So an example of a bad open loop is, hey, you won't believe what happens next. This is massively overused, right? Viewers have seen this generic open loop a thousand times. It's too generic and it doesn't give the viewer a reason to care. So, what's what's the point of having of saying you won't believe what happens next, right? It's kind of a lame way.

It's a lazy way of writing an open loop. So, you really want to be specific enough to hint at what's coming, but don't reveal too much information. Really, that's the key of an open loop. So, if you can say, "Hey, this one mistake cost me $10,000 and here's how you can avoid it, right?" So, the viewer wants to learn what this specific mistake is, and it creates curiosity because they want to avoid making the same mistake.

 Mistake number two is resolving the open loop too soon. So, if you answer your open loop immediately, there's no tension being built up, right? So, the viewer gets the payoff without having to watch the rest of the video. So when you create a open loop, right, that you create this anticipation for the payoff, right? And if you pay that off way too early, so the gap between your open loop and the payoff is very short, then it's like, okay, they already got that opening hit and then they're just going to leave, right? So you don't want to resolve the open loop too soon. It kind of just has to be just nice. So example of bad open loop is, hey, in this video, I'll tell you how I doubled my income by raising my prices, right? So, it's like this is literally like one sentence, but usually people do it uh gaps in between a couple of sentences, which isn't which isn't good enough, right? So, resolution comes way too quickly. There's no reason to keep watching. So, how to fix it, right? You want to delay the payoff and stretch it out across the video, right? So, maybe instead of paying it off within the first minute of opening the loop, you want to do it three to four minutes later before you create another open

loop. So, an example of a good open loop, right? Okay, this is more like setting expectations, but in this video, I'll show you how I doubled my income in 30 days, but the way I did it might surprise you. More on that in a minute, right? So, it's like, okay, why would it surprise you, right? So, you delay the answer, you build anticipation with this open loop.

 And mistake three is to forgetting to close the open loop, right? So, an unresolved open loop feels like a broken promise, right? Viewers feels frustrated and they'll be less likely to trust your future content. So, it's creating a curiosity gap and you don't resolve this curiosity gap. So you don't even have a payoff basically or if your open loop is not related to the payoff.

 So it's like you have a setup and then the setup isn't paid off by the payoff, right? So that's one of the mistakes that we talked about when writing payoffs. You definitely want to pay off the open loop or the setup that you created initially. So example of a bad open loop, right? Starting a video with I'll show you how to make $1,000 this week but never explaining how to do it at the end.

 Right? So like the whole video if you talk about something else that's totally not related no good right so you want to always deliver on the promise so plan your script to ensure every open loop gets resolved and you know this also comes back to creating the best content possible right that's from doing your research that's really from understanding your audience it's how can you deliver the best content possible so example of a good open loop closure right remember when I mentioned that one strategy to make $1,000 this week start with and then the whole video you go over it so those are like the three common mistakes really um and And now that you know how to avoid those common mistakes, you can start writing perfect open loops for your scripts. And you can do that with my four-step open loop framework. So, uh, these are kind of a couple requirements for what I deem to be a strong open loop. You don't have to have all of these requirements, but this is more of a guideline um when writing these open loops. So, let's let's look at this, right? Number one, start with curiosity, right? Ask yourself, what unresolved question will keep my audience watching? So, how did I double my income in 30 days? What's the number one mistake every beginner makes on YouTube? Why did my most expensive video completely tank? Right? If you can

create open loops around these questions that lead to your next point that acts as a setup, I think that is super powerful. Right? So, the question should directly appeal to your audience's interests and pain points. So, interest is what your audience likes and pain points are problems that your audience wants to solve.

 So, your open loops need to appeal to either of them to be considered a strong open loop. Step two in writing an open loop is to build tension. So, you want to create enough tension to hook the viewer, but don't resolve it too soon, right? As I said, one of the mistakes is resolving uh it too soon. So, you want to build tension.

So, like tension is kind of like when when they're stressed, right? The viewer really wants to know what it is, but you don't release the tension too early. So, this one mistake cost me $10,000, right? Stay tuned to find out what it was. Right? I found a way to double retention rates, but it's something most creators overlook, right? The second one especially is pretty strong, right? It's something creators most most creators overlook.

 Why do most creators overlook it? Right? And this creates a bunch of questions that you'll later want to resolve. I'll share more about that later, right? You'll see exactly how I did it in a minute. Number three is the strategic delay, right? So, it's to not just rely on one open loop. Is to introduce new loops throughout the video to maintain engagement, right? So, you really want to layer your open loop.

 So, you say you start with, hey, this strategy doubled my revenue in 30 days. Uh, and I'm going to talk about that later. And then midway you be like, hey, but before I show you that, let me tell you about the mistake that held me back for years. Right? So, kind of like when you're watching a movie, there's like multiple story plots, right? Uh you kind of have the Aplot and the Bplot going on.

 So, like the Aplot is like maybe say the main plot for the character and there's a Bplot going on. So, you know, usually these two plots are moving in conjunction and sometimes you switch between the two, right? And but Aplot really is like the main video timeline uh or like the main thing that's happening in the video. But you also want to have a Bplot and and kind of the Bplot is like, "Hey, let me tell you about this other thing that's also adjacently related to um the plot A, right? Which is like the main the main content of the video. You can create a secondary open loop within your video that makes this um that makes this super strong and uh improves your retention that way." That's one of the ways that I think about it, too. Another example, right, the main loop is, "Hey, this one strategy double my income." Secondary loop was first, let me show you the mistake that cost me $10,000. Um and you know the supporting loop is the reason this works is fascinating. So here you're really like layering your open loops. It's not just like one sentence right that the open loop is you don't just say uh one sentence and just hope that okay they get hooked by it right you can layer it right so you can create

curiosity it's like hey if you continue watching you'll get this benefit uh and it will alleviate this pain. So, there's a multiple different layers you can do to it um to really build up that curiosity and really hype up the point that you're talking about. And once again, the thing is when you really really want to hype up the point like, "Hey, you're going to get all of this.

You're going to get all of this. You're going to get all of this when you continue watching, you need to pay it off, right? The the actual content that you deliver really needs to deliver on the promise that you made. And if you don't deliver on the promise, uh that really limits the the that really limits the viewer satisfaction.

 That really limits uh the strength of your video, how actually good the content is. So you really want to pay off when you have massive open loops when you create this massive curiosity. I want to emphasize that over and over again because it's really easy to just write these open loops to improve retention and never deliver on it.

 And if you don't ever deliver on it, that's when uh that's when that's when your audience, you know, isn't as loyal, isn't as strong. So step four is to always close the loop, right? Once again, when you create a loop, make sure to resolve it by the end of the video. So I'll show you the number one strategy.

 I used to double my income, right? Build up the tension, explaining the mistakes you made before finding the strategy and then deliver on the payoff. Right? Now, here's the strategy. I promise raise my prices and simplify my offer. So when you write open loops, you can ask yourself these questions to make sure that your open loops are always a hit.

 Right? Number one, does your open loop spark curiosity? Right? Are you creating a need to know for feeling for the viewer? Right? Does the viewer like feel the need to know to feel the need to want to continue watching? Right? Does your open loop connect to the audience's interest? So, is it relevant to their pain points and their interest? Does it fit naturally into the video? Right? So, if the open loops kind of feel like it's disjointed or it's coming out of nowhere, that's no good, right? It should feel like a seamless part of the narrative. It's like, hey, speaking of this, let's talk about this right now. Right? So that's also a seamless way to transition from one section to another. And yeah, if this info is a lot to take in, right, really it's going to take some time to write banger open loops. So um let's talk about how to learn how to write open loops. Here are some tips to fast track the process. So number one, when learning how to write open loops, you want to analyze other creators, right? Pick great creators, find YouTubers who keep you hooked until the end, right? Mr. Beast, Ali Abdal, or whoever. Your favorite creators all use open loops, right? They have a way of pushing you to the next step of the story, to the next step of the video. You want to see how they actually do it,

how they do their transitions. Pay attention to how they start their video, how they keep you curious in the middle, and see how they answer the question at the end without losing you, and how they transition from point to point. So, write down the examples of open loops that made you stay.

 For example, u if they say, "What happened to next shock to everyone?" Then maybe that's something you can look at, right? Save these in a simple list to use later or any other open loops, right? You want to have this all in the list. And really you can use simple formulas, right? Curiosity, right? What happened next might surprise you, right? If there are certain strong open loops that really stand out, you want to take all of that down.

 And you know, you start with certain simple formulas and then over time you can uh use more complex open loops. Right? Here's how I fixed it. And what you can learn, right? Everything was great until it falls apart. Everything was great until it all fell apart. Right? So that's for conflict. And then when you're writing open loops, aka transitions from one point to another, right? Write three versions.

Pick one topic, write through open loops. And yeah, so for this video, how I got 1 million views, right? I found one trick that got me 1 million views. You won't believe it. Maybe that one may not not super strong, right? This simple change got me 1 million views. Maybe this is a little bit better, right? Here's how I hit 1 million views in a month and it's not what you think, right? Couple versions of open loops.

And then you want to layer open loops into your script, right? Start with a big question, right? Add more curiosity halfway through the video, right? Make sure to answer everything at the end. Make sure to resolve the open loop is what I'm trying to say here. And yeah, write every day, right? Spend 15 minutes a day writing open loops, right? Probably within seven days, you'll get really good at it.

 What I found changed everything, but no one told me about it. It made a huge mistake, right? This one hack saved me hours. And I'll show you how. Once again, when you see a great open loop, write it down and then try rewriting it, adapting it for your own script. Right? Does it make people curious? Is it clear enough to understand? Would you keep watching? If it answers all these questions, then you're good to go in terms of your open loop.

 the summary, analyze other creators, practice writing open loops as often as possible, keep revising, and really just copy what works is uh the easiest way to start learning, right? And to make the process easier, keep a swipe file of each of the best open loops you see other creators using. Good swipe file should include all of your open loops, right? So really best open loops, I have it all in a folder.

 And then in your open loops, it should explain why it works and any other additional insights that you have, right? With the open loops, why it works, any additional insights. You can see here open loop is Bruce Wayne left Gotham became Batman. The goal of this video is to teach you how to replicate that.

 Right? That's setting expectations because of curiosity framing video. Right? So like really it's it's less so the words that are being used in open loop that are important but it's more so the psychology behind it. Right? If you can break down the psychology that is super impactful. And yeah I I have my own personal swipe file.

 Uh if you want it you can click the link in description. It will be in the workbook. Um so you can get access to it. my favorite um my favorite open loops are all the way in there. There you go. I'll get out there and write some open loops. And uh just so you guys can see how I think about writing open loops, um I have a buddy who just wrote a script.

The open loops aren't great. So, we're going to read the script and um we're going to look at the open loops and we're going to see how we can modify it. So, let's switch tabs here. Okay. So, I got my buddy over here, right? Uh $80,000 in one month as a creative founder, $80,000 in one month with IG.

So, this video is basically about Instagram growth and how to book calls, how to make money uh with Instagram. So, let's talk about this, right? Let's uh let's give the hook a brief read and then uh we'll immediately look at the transitions and the open loops because I think that's the most valuable part here.

 In the month of April, we processed $80,000 with only a following of 7,000 followers. I did this without earning ads, going viral, or doing outreach. I didn't do what all the content gurus ask you to do. I didn't have to post three times a day, copy viral hooks, or check off some secret Instagram setting you didn't know about because I understood how to uniquely position my content.

 Today, I'll show you the three principles I infused my I infused in my into my content that took me from just another content guru to a personal brand that carved out a section of the niche just for himself. But first, you need to know the only way to be seen as the go-to guy or girl in your niche is by seeing you over again.

 Each time they see you, the mental real estate of your handsome face girls. So, we need to optimize for them coming back over and over again or what I call recurring views. Okay, this pretty good right here. Really, uh, the first point starts here, right? But first, you need to know the only way to be seen as the go-to guy in your niche is by being seen over and over again.

 So, here here we do have a transition, right? But we immediately go into explaining um, we go immediately into explaining the topic, right? So if we look at it from a transition point of view, yeah, it kind of makes sense, but it doesn't really induce curiosity, right? So how can we rewrite this to induce some sort of curiosity within the open loop? So let's see again.

 Today I'll show you the three principles to a personal brand that coughed out a section of the niche just for himself. And if you write the first step, first principle has to do with the first principle has to do with something that 99% of creators get wrong, but is the most important if you want to convert. viewers into sales.

 So, and then we have to rewrite this, right? If you want to be seen as the go-to guy, the go-to expert, right, in your niche, you need to be seen over and over again because each time So, we add transition here, right? Because each time they see you, the mental real estate, the mental real estate that your handsome face occupies in their minds that uh occupies, you don't in their mind cuz you already said mental real estate, right? That your hands occupies increases.

Most creators optimize for views for nonfollowers, but we also want to optimize for them coming back over and over again or what I call recurring views. Right? So, this the first P was has to do with has to do with Yeah. has to do with something that 99% of creators get wrong, but it's the most important if you want to convert viewers into sales, right? So, this is an easy open loop framework.

 Hey, most people get this wrong, but it's super duper important, right? So, you here you can create a contrast. Creating a contrast is a great way of creating an open loop because they're like, hey, what is this contrast? Like, why why do I need this? Right? So, here we create an open loop. So, here he goes into the value, right? There are two two main types of value blah blah blah, right? Right? And then he goes into value.

 He says value versus insight is important. Right? He says you want to give insight. Right? So this is the drive you need to create in videos. So whatever call to action you use, follow you, check out your link in bio, keyword or comment, they're much more likely to take action. It's so funny how by giving the viewer more information, you can create an even stronger one for information.

 But I actually revealed to you the last step. And here's the harsh proof. It doesn't matter if you have the most valuable life-changing piece of insight ever if you don't have this one thing. What I'm going to talk about is the difference. So here you can kind of see it's a little bit disjointed, right? So I'm going to think, okay, how can I link this up? So usually it it it feels disjointed because a lot of us script like this, right? We have like the headline and then we just write for each. So an easy way is to just delete this and then you can immediately see, hey, does it actually link up, right? So I want to just read it. uh and see how it flows. If it doesn't make sense, then we immediately need to change it, right? So, let's see. Doesn't matter if you have the most valuable life chain insight if you don't have this one thing. So, you can see here he's trying to like create uh curiosity, right? But kind of doesn't work super well. What I want to talk about is the difference between you giving a piece of sales advice and Alex Mosy giving the same advice. See, too many entros this up when I see videos like this on my feed. I was actually doing this a couple months ago until I realized how stupid it was. So you can see he is trying to

create a curiosity but the transition here isn't super smooth. All right. So here he was says integrating proof is kind of the point that he's trying to make here. So funny how by giving the viewer more information you can create an even stronger want for information. This sentence isn't isn't even like super strong right? With each new question you have you get hungrier for the answer.

 This is drive you need to create in your videos. So whatever this is the curiosity you want to create in your videos. So, whatever call to action you use, whether it's to follow you, check out the link in bio or comment keyword, your viewers are much more likely to follow through with the action. So, kind of the problem here is like, hey, you say it's so funny, but I actually revealed to you the last step.

 So, it kind of feels like uh I I'm not sure if this this is a sense that you guys get, but when I'm reading this, there is a there's kind of a gap here like uh we don't completely wrap up the first point and then we immediately transition to the next point, right? So, really when we're ending a point, uh we really want to foot mark it aka we want to make it clear that we're ending the point.

 It needs to be obvious that we're ending the point. And uh the way that we end the point, we want to end it with something punchy, right? So we can call it a zinger. I call it a zinger. So you really want to give it like a like a left hand hook so that it's clear that hey, right? Uh we're going to finish this point here.

 And then we're going to transition to something else. Right? So there needs to be a punchy oneliner, actionable oneliner. So here there isn't really an actual oneliner. So it feels kind of disjointed when you read it, right? The point isn't super complete. So let's see how we can do this. This is the curiosity you want to create in your videos.

 So whatever call to action you use, whether it's to follow you, check out the link in bio or comment a keyword, your viewers are much more likely to follow through. So here he mentions insight over here. Like the main point that he wants to say is use insight, right? Uh when you give them an insight, they actually get hungrier, right? So it's actually not giving them more information.

 So here he's kind of like there's like kind of a gap in the script. Um, give the viewer a banger insight. Break beliefs, break their internal beliefs, and they'll be sitting on the edge of their seat waiting for you to post your next reel. So, here I want to like wrap up the whole point. So, but actually review to the last step.

 And in here, you can just cut this. Here's the harsh truth. So, like really when I'm editing, and we're going to go over this in the editing module, right? There's a lot that I cut, right? When I edit first, right? To edit is to um to edit is to cut, right? So, really, I want to or like to to write is to edit.

 Like there there's a quote, something like that. But really, when I'm editing, I want to cut as much as possible. There's usually a lot of fluff in writing. So here, but it doesn't matter if you have the most life-changing piece of insight ever if you don't have if you don't supplement it with this next thing I'm going to talk about, right? Thing I'm I'm not a super fan of, right? But maybe let's just make a comment, right? Not a fan of thing what I'm I'm about to share.

What I'm about to share is the difference between you giving a piece of sales advice and Alex Mosy and I see it frustrates me, right? I see so many entrepreneurs f this up. I see when I see videos when I see videos like this on my feed, it frustrates me. So like also like another thing that I want to look at is like these sentences are like relatively long.

 Maybe you can just cut this in half, you know, like make the sentences shorter. I was actually doing this a couple months ago until so like so here you realize that you know when I'm when I'm reading the script and guess what let's say you're making videos like this right here uh we need to um storyboard this right- which we'll go over in a later module but he's like hey when I go over videos like this right for example when he says like this right he'll put this into a teleprompter and you'll put it uh on screen but it's going to be very very difficult to follow because I'm not sure when he says like like this like what what he's referring to, right? So, um this is something that we we'll go over within the storyboarding module that I think is super important. Don't want to give zero authority to the market. I can't tell the two of you apart. Okay, so we're just looking at open loops here, but you can see here how he kind of like stacks the loops. Uh but you also want to vary the sentence length and something we're going to go over within the editing module, right? But here really we want to um really main lesson from this. Hey, you want to like uh bookmark or like your mark that hey, right, I'm ending

the point here. You want to wrap up the pointfully before you transition to the next one. So, let me just put this here. Proof. And I think this was a heading. Hopefully, this was heading too. Maybe. There you go. Okay. So, let's let's uh let's transition to this. Right. So, he says proof basically blah blah proof.

Right. So, I my editor showed their most recent videos and how they actually went viral, right? Proof creates a competitive mode and demonstrates authority in a space full of gurus helping you stand out from everyone else, which means more leads. Now the thing is authority is only built towards the middle or end of the video.

Authority requires watch time. The viewer needs to have a good reason to use that time on your video. Now the thing is authority is only built towards the middle or end of the video. This sentence doesn't make sense. Yeah. Like I I I I've already gone through this script of him kind of briefly and I was like, "Hey, I made a comment that this sentence doesn't really make sense.

" Right? The viewer needs to have a good reason to devote time to watching your video, right? So, watching your video. So, here we don't really have this, right? Your video needs to be compelling enough within the first 3 seconds to beat out the cat video or degenerate degenerate memes or only fans videos or the only fans girls.

 And so like here we like, hey, there needs to be a good reason for them to devote time to watching your video. And uh and in order for them to devote time to watching your video, you need to master you need to master this next strategy. Okay, that that's something that just came up, right? And and to get viewers to commit to watching your video, you need to master the art of the the art of packaging.

 So here you can be like, "Hey, need to master the art of packaging." I think like this is like a good enough transition, right? Because like hey, what's the art of packaging or packaging in uh in in IG um is it is is kind of broad. So it's kind of broad and also like curiosity inducing. I don't think anyone really uses this other than him.

 So it's like hey you need to master the art of packaging, right? Your video needs to be compelling enough within the first 3 seconds to beat out the cat videos. So there you go. You need to first master the art of packaging. That's another open loop there. So this is kind of how you can think about adding open loops, right? Really there needs to be some curiosity factor.

 I kind of like explained my thought process. How do you make sure the transition from one point leads to another? And you can see here when you don't really have open loops, when you don't really have transitions, it feels very choppy, right? And I guarantee you if you look at your own scripts, you'll realize, hey, the transitions are really choppy right now without the open loops.

So kind of like a couple hacks, right? It's like you want to link it together. You want to wrap up the point properly before you do the next setup. And I think that will drastically improve your open loops. So that's exactly how you write open loops. Once again, if you want to get my open loop swipe file, you can click the link in the description.

It will be within the workbook. So I'll just send it directly to your inbox. And yeah, so that's how to write open loops. Now once we've written open loops at this point, we've written hooks, we've written payoffs, we've written the open loops. So, that's pretty much the full body of the video.

 Now, we need the viewers to actually take action at the end of your video once you've gotten them to watch from start to finish. Really, taking action is the main thing which leads to conversions. So, let's talk about how to write a call to action, a banner call to action that actually converts. Call to action CTA is basically a prompt at the end of your video to get the viewer to take what action you want them to take.

 Right here, just an example of a simple call to action. So, there are three types of call to actions, right? One is to sell them on watching another video on your channel. So, that's with an endcreen element. Show you what it looks like. Sling them on liking and subscribing rather than selling them on your offer or product or product pitch.

And you usually use an end screen to accomplish this, right? An end screen is what you add as a clickable element in your video. So you can see here at the end of my 33minute video, it's like, hey, click on this video over here. Uh on the screen, it's an end screen element.

 But I bet you're asking yourself, why don't you say if you like the video, make sure to like and subscribe. Right? Lots of business owners to this day still do this. Hey, make sure to like and subscribe or like leave a comment. Blah blah blah. All of that doesn't really matter, right? Um because if the content is valuable enough, the viewers will like and subscribe on their own.

 And kind of there's this thing on YouTube right now where like subscribers don't really matter. Um there are channels with millions of subscribers that can barely get a thousand views on their videos. So subscribers don't really matter anymore. Comments, you know, comments don't really comments drive a little bit of engagement, but it doesn't really boost the views.

 it doesn't mean it doesn't signal to the YouTube algorithm that hey this is something that we should continue pushing right so um if the content is valuable enough viewers will like and subscribe on their own that's kind of like the hard truth about um telling people to like and subscribe like this is in 2015 you know so that's something that you really want to think about usually you wouldn't tell them to like and subscribe so probably thinking but Brian what about selling my course product or service right but really here's what nobody tells you about pitching on YouTube. The timing of your pitch matters more than the pitch itself, right? If you really want to sell something on YouTube, most of you guys may be watching this have your own business behind this. Um, or you know, you want to pitch some sort of sponsor, right? When do you pitch, right? And when should you not pitch? Okay, I have a couple personal philosophies on this and uh if you ask other people, they'll tell you different things, right? And this is also something that's always evolving, right? It's not something that's always stagnant. So, but uh as of 2025, right, this is my personal

philosophy behind a pitch, right? Pitching an offer. It can be hard to pitch an offer without sounding like a sellout, right? And I don't recommend that you don't pitch at all, right? Because uh at the end of the day, if you're running a business and really you're starting YouTube as like a lead generation source, it is important to know when to pitch your offer.

 But if you pitch your offer too many times, right, in your videos, your core audience will eventually think that you're a sellout and, you know, won't come back to watching your channel. So, you need to do it very smart. In general, my philosophy is that you only pitch an offer in a 40-minute plus videos because that's when the viewer has gotten massive amounts of value from your video.

 And I feel that's only that's the only time that you have permission to pitch. Other than that, I generally wouldn't pitch to the viewer because if your video is 10 to 20 minutes long, there just isn't enough information transferred to justify a pitch. So, really just don't pitch unless you have a 40 minute plus video because for after 40 minute plus video, right? You tell them to book a call, if you tell them to buy uh whatever product or whatever course that you have, I think it then it makes sense after they've watched from start to finish, they really understand all of the sales arguments. really their beliefs has been broken and they trust you because they've learned a lot from watching your videos then does it really really really make sense to do a pitch at the end of the video otherwise I personally wouldn't um hard pitch anything I wouldn't do anything too crazy with regards to pitch um especially not in a 10 to 20 minute video so that's something that you definitely want to be conscious of so what do you pitch right instead uh of in a 10 to 20-minute video just pitching uh you know people to buy

a product at the end of every video you should pitch another video right so when you do a call to action at the end of your video to another the end screen clickthrough rate will increase right so when viewers go from one video to another on your channel to another on your channel it creates a sort of spiderweb that will solve all of your prospect's problems at one time so really you want to think of your YouTube channel kind of as a spiderweb and when someone gets caught in one of your videos and they watch it to the end because it's a good video They'll watch another video and then this video will end screen call to action to this other video to this other video to this other video to this other video to this other video. So eventually it becomes like a spiderweb. As long as someone gets caught in it and watches your highquality video all the way to the end, they'll start watching more videos on your channel and that really increases the session time. That really increases um kind of the viewer satisfaction from watching your video. So, this is a big reason of why I really like pitching to another video because it gets people to watch even more, right? Increases the watch time on your channel as I said, right? Which leads to a boost in the algorithm. So, really,

for example, if you post a video that's a one of 10, right? Uh this video is kind of like about ideiation, about uh about storytelling a little bit, you know, kind of like there's different stuff that we talk about within that, right? And the at the end of this video, my call to action was, "Hey, if you want to learn how to write hooks, call to actions, and a body, how to research your time in half.

 I highly recommend that you watch my full script writing guide. I go through I go through everything that you need to know about how to write a great YouTube script. It's about an hour and it's 30 minutes long, but I guarantee it's the best video that you will watch today. Right? Click over here to watch it and I'll see you in the next one.

" Right? And then you add endcreen elements at the end of it taking them to a full 1hour course. Guess what happened? Right? Really, you can see a spike, right? Uh you can see that there's uh there's a big spike just because um I did a call to action at the end of the video, right? With one video popping off.

 So kind of when you have one video that performs well that gets people to watch till the end, that is an incentive for them to come back and watch another video that you did an end screen clicker rate on. And because I did this with like a lot of my videos, right, my full script writing course that was me with my glasses uh continues to get views.

 It's at about 220k views right now. All the all this you can do by writing a strong call to action. So here's how you can do the same thing. Going to give you my framework for writing endcreen call to actions. It's nothing super duper complicated and um you can literally write it within 5 minutes, right? And and really if you can write it within 5 minutes and you can get outsized returns if you have one video that performs well.

 It's literally free views. Spend 5 minutes on it. Nothing super complicated, right? And remember how I mentioned getting three times more clicks on end screens than the average YouTube channel, right? This is the tree pot framework I use to achieve that. Nothing too crazy. It's the hook, curiosity, action framework, right? And this can be written in less than 100 words, maybe like 50, 60 words, right? Um if need be.

 It can be written as short as that. Doesn't have to be super complex with this call to action. Really simplicity is the name of the game, right? When I explain any of these, if it seems complex, kind of like my job is not done well, really. I want to break this down into something as simple as possible.

 So, hook, curiosity, action. You want to hook their attention just before the end of the video because that's when they think there's no more value. So, uh at the end of the video, they can kind of see the the timeline. You want to hook them in one more time, right? So, an example is, hey, so that's how you can edit three YouTube videos in only one week while working for 4 hours per day.

 With this process, you'll be able to churn out videos real quickly. So you want to hook them in right after that you can quickly transition to the answer to that question you implanted in their minds which you use a curiosity for. So once again you hook the viewer in right open loops acts as a hook too right at the call to action you want to use a hook too like the hook this hook is also function as a open loop creates some sort of curiosity and really specifically in this curiosity you want to create a knowledge gap uh which creates demand for what you're about to pitch next. So for an example, but a fast turnover means that you can start taking in more clients. We hook them in again. It brings up a new problem that the viewers need to solve. So now that you know this and I've solved your problems with this and you can edit videos much faster, here's a new problem that you're going to have. This is the next problem that you're going to have, right? So you bring in a new problem uh that can be solved for them, right? And then action, right? Action means the action you want them to take. Which is why I created this video. This is the action now. This is what which is why I created this video to close so many editing clients. You never run out of work link and then you just thank them

for watching. You can thank them for watching if you want. Simple. After introducing a new problem, encouraging viewers to solve that problem by watching the next video. There you go. It's the hook curiosity action framework. And because of that, they click until watch your next video and the click rate source, right? Ends clean click rate is better.

 And once again, I always get the same question. Is it worth the effort? The typical end screen element click rate to another video on your channel is 3%. Really, if maybe you don't write it super well, right, and it increases to 5%. That's that's an extra 60% of people is 60% 66% of people, right? 3% to 5% that because you scripted it well and say you get a million views, an extra 66% of people who watch till the end will convert uh to watching another of your video, right? And if this another of your video pitches a product there, then you can see it's like totally different, right? So really just spend a little bit of effort and literally it's free views. You don't even have to generate new views because you use this call to action framework to another video. It generates new views. It generates more watch time. It potentially generates new subscribers because people spend more time on your channel. And yeah, it's just it's just much better with my channel, my client's channels, right? using this framework, our end screen

element clickthrough rate is always above average, right? If it's not 5%, it's 10%. It can go up to 15 to 20% uh in some videos when the link between the two videos is super compelling. But you don't just want to do a call to action to a random video, right? As I said, when you create the curiosity gap, once again, there must be a gap that the viewer needs to fill.

 And the stronger this gap, this the more likely people will want to click, right? So that's kind of contingent on how well you write this curiosity gap. So remember this, right? Don't pitch in every video, right? Encourage the viewers to watch another video in your call to action and um follow the treeod framework, right? And when you're pitching a product is it's the exact same thing, right? You want to hook the viewer in.

 Again, create a curiosity. So there's a gap. Hey, now that you've watched this video, you know all of these things, but I personally uh cannot dedicate my time um unless I'm being paid or something like that. And then you do a call to action to your course, right? Um, hey, hey, now that you know all of this, right, you actually need to learn all of this, right? And this is something that I can't cover in one YouTube video.

 So that's why you can click the link in the description and I'll I'll do it for you. Even the call to actions that I have had throughout this video, right? It's like, hey, click the workbook. I'll send it directly to your inbox. It solves a specific problem for them, right? Solves a specific problem for you, right? If you click the link in the description, get the workbook, it will make your life a ton easier, right? Because you don't have to uh scroll over this video, rewatch it, right? You can actually just take that, take those pieces of information, right, within the workbook and go apply it within your channel and immediately get results. Because really, the goal of getting the viewer to take action isn't just to grow your channel, right? It's so that your viewer gets results. And when your viewer gets results, when you guys get results from watching this video that I've put together thousands,500 plus slides, this will actually like hugely benefit you and you know ideally you guys turn into subscribers, you guys turn into more loyal fans just because

you're able to watch this video from start to finish. Does that make sense? Right. So that's the call to action. Right. So now I'm going to write a couple call to actions live. Uh I'll break down a couple call to actions that I've written so that you guys can have a look at how it's done.

 So I have this video titled uh from one of the students within the discord, right? How to learn anything so fast it feels illegal, right? And uh this is taken from a good outlier format and um yeah, I think a couple months ago I helped review the script and write the hook for this. But let's look at the call to action, right? How to learn anything so fast it feels legal.

 So over here, let's just go over a couple of points. Get feedback early and often, right? At some point, you just have to start. You want to rest. Okay, these are good points. The power of obsession, changing your identity. There you go. And an outro, right? So, let's see how you write out, right? Hopefully, these tips will help you learn faster and achieve your goals more effectively.

 Oh, and YouTube thinks this video is perfect for you. Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one. So, here it's like kind of like a vague call to action. Um, I think this call to action is okay if this is your first video on your channel and you don't really know what your next video is.

 So, you can't really do a call to action to another video. But if you have other videos on your channel already that you want to direct traffic towards that you know, hey, once they watch this video, naturally they should watch this other video, then um you want to do a more concrete call to action. So, let's see how we can rewrite this.

 So, this um is about how to learn anything. So, I'd imagine this is for students, right? But now that you've learned my secret productivity techniques, the only thing missing is for you to apply it. Right? So, let's see. The only thing missing is for you to apply it. So, you don't need a button.

 Right? Now, now that you've learned my secret, my secret pro my personal productivity techniques for getting straight A's in school. The only thing missing is the only thing missing is for you to apply it. It's why I developed a simple framework for you to follow. Ah, okay. So here you give like productivity techniques, right? So let's say you have a video on uh my productivity schedule.

 Um it's for you to apply it is uh is for you to apply it. So and because I want to make it as simple as possible for you to copy my p my productivity calendar. I made this video breaking down my day in the life. Breaking down my my a my day in the life as a uh Harvard student. Click over here to watch it and I'll see you in the next one.

 Um I'm kind of just like coming up with stuff here, right? These are like placeholders, right? This is like my day in the life, right? Uh simple as simple as possible for you to copy my productivity calendar. Kind of depends on the video that you want to do a call to action to, right? Say you want to do a call to action to a day in the life video.

 It's like, hey, copy my productivity calendar or um breaking down Yeah. breaking down my day in the life as a Harvard student. Yeah, I think I think this is good. And obviously you modify this uh according to the video that you'd want to do a call to action to but I think it makes sense to hey right once I've given you my productivity techniques I want to show you how I apply it in my day in the life over here you can see right I've hooked them in right the only thing missing is for you to apply it and here I create a curiosity app hey copy my productivity calendar so and then I do an action here right uh you can click um over here to watch the video to watch my day in the live so that we when we create this information gap, we want to immediately create demand for them to continue watching. Right? So this is exactly what I've done here. Let's look at another script and we'll write maybe one or two more call to actions. Okay, let's do this video. So you can see over here if I started a YouTube channel, this is what I do, right? So if you have this video title, right? Let's see in the video what they talk about in last

videos I grew my channel to 2 million and generate over all of these, right? and kind of has a couple examples here. Main payoff is to have a personal strategy, right? First step is finding your field. So that's like finding your niche. Just briefly browse this, right? So I can get an idea of the script and how to do call to action packaging, right? And then here do research, do script writing, hook, body, call to action, confirm video expectations, finding the gaps, right? All right, this is the exact personal strategy I use and many of my students have used to grow and get monetized on YouTube. Hope this helps. If you want more of these unique insights, click the link below to join my community. That's for today. See you in the next one. So, what's kind of wrong with this call to action or like what's missing, right? This is a pretty standard call to action that most YouTubers are, hey, just like blink here if you want more of this. There needs to be a clear benefit when you're getting the viewer to take an action. Right? Number one, um I would do a call to action to another video here because this seems like a shorter video. Kind of

like if you look at the video length here, it's about a thousand words. So, it's going to be like about uh like a 6-minute video. Number one, I would do a call to action to another video. But let's say that hey, he really really wants to do a call to action to the community.

 Let's see how we can write a more refined call to action to the community. Right? So, once again, we want to hook them in. We want to create a gap. So in this case the gap will be like hey this is what this is where you want to be this is where you are this is where you want to be and the community is the solution right so that's where you can click that's where you can um click here for call to action so let's see how we can write and create that gap so we want to hook them in right so if you want to master the one skill many YouTubers overlook identifying content gaps you've already set yourself your pot set yourself apart and positioned to win now that you've got your personal strategy How do you actually know that it will work and what is the best way to implement it? I for one know that accountability is one of the most important factors when learning

um when growing on YouTube. Even Mr. Beast, let me make this a little bigger so you guys can see. Right. Even Mr. Beast had a group of five friends that he obsessed over YouTube with when he first started out 10 years ago. That's why I started a community of YouTube creators where we help where I'll help you blah blah blah, right? So, I'll help you um craft a personal strategy um post um my personal YouTube data so you can see what works and doesn't work and blah blah blah.

 So, basically what I'm trying to say here is like hey this is everything that you'll get if you join a community right so once again right now that you know the personal strategy and what is the best way to implement it. So I hook them in and then you want to create a gap, right? I for one know that accountability is one of the most important factors when growing on YouTube, right? So here we create the gap, right? We create the gap for accountability.

 Let's say accountability is the main thing that you want to push in terms of this community, right? So click the link in description in the description if you want my help to get monetized on YouTube in the next 30 days. So immediately I give a benefit. Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one.

 So, here you can see this is a little bit of a longer call to action, but that's because you're telling people to um I'm not sure whether this is a paid community, right? Or whether this is a free community, right? But here, we really really want to create a reason for the viewer to click.

 In in this case, committing to a community is quite a lot, right? Because you have to uh let's say it's a paid community, right? they're going to have to pay something in order to join. So that it's quite a big commitment. There needs to be a big reason for them to want to do it, right? And um yeah, there you go.

 So here we kind of have a call to action that we just crafted out of thin air. Uh could you make this a little bit shorter? Sure. But this is like a good baseline, right? I just like wrote this in in like 2 minutes. And um right, it also depends on the context, right? When you're writing your own script, you'll have a little bit more context for what you want to do the call to action to, right? the what the main selling point of the community is.

 And yeah, just like that. And so yeah, that's how you write a banger call to action to get your viewers to actually take action on what you want them to take action on, right? That's how that's how you write a banger call to action. And by this point, just to recap, research, hooks, payoffs, um, open loops, call to actions.

 We've pretty much written the whole script if you combine all of this together. But the next step is probably one of the most crucial. It's what people pay me the most money for. It's really where my brains and expertise come in. It's editing the script. Right? If you don't know how to edit the script, the script will never come out good.

 And we've done a little bit of preview in terms of how I think about it. You've been able to see me live edit a couple scripts, edit hooks, edit some of the payoffs, edit some of the open loops. But right now, I want to go over some of the core principles that I think about when I'm editing scripts so that you can apply them when you're editing your own script. So, let's get right into it.

Let's switch to the slides. Now that you guys are here, I just want to say thank you for staying all the way to this point and really learning the skill of like YouTube script writing because I do believe it's one of probably the most important skills to have in content creation today and it's probably one of the most valuable skills to have.

 So, thank you for investing your time in this video, but let's get into editing. So, let's talk about real quick before the specific method on how to edit your script is why is editing important? Because when you master editing, everything changes, right? you cut your writing time in half because you don't just spend all of your time, right? Just like sitting around waiting to write your first draft.

 You get your first draft out and then you edit the script, right? And that really cuts your time in half rather than writing, editing, writing, editing, writing, editing. Your brain switches gears and it's just not super duper productive. When you master editing, everything changes, right? You cut your writing time in half.

 There's less revisions and production time is wasted. um and you make your scripts more high quality just because you edit it, right? When you spend more time working on something, uh presumably the quality is better, right? And this is especially true for writing. So, your first draft is for dumping ideas, right? Editing shapes uh those ideas into a coherent and polished narrative.

 And a well- edited script makes your audience stay engaged and makes them take action. So, how to edit, right? I made the power method for editing your script. So, let's get into it. Pause. Okay. And most people don't really do this. They go straight from writing the first draft to immediately editing it.

 But after finishing your first draft of your video, I want you to take a break because this incubation period allows you to return to your script when you go and edit it with fresh eyes. So even after a short break, like an hour, it can really help you spot things that you've missed. And this works because it's easier to identify weak spots when you're not emotionally attached to the writing.

 spending some time away from your work can reveal new ideas or better ways to phrase things immediately. Once you write a script and you edit it, you're like emotionally attached. Oh, I spent a lot of time. But really, when you distance yourself, which um I think that's the power of the pause, right? When you distance yourself, you're not super emotionally attached to the script.

 You're not like your ego isn't in the way like, hey, this actually pretty good. You get to see it from a third person lenses. when you notice that you're critiquing someone else's video, it's a lot easier to critique it because it's from a third person lens, um, you are less emotionally attached to it.

 But when you critique your video, you're just not that great at critiquing your own video, right? There's a lot of blind spots that you have because you're emotionally invested into the video. Um, so that's why it's good to consult experts. It's good to get a third eye, second eye onto your stuff.

 And, uh, you want to act as your third eye onto your content. Take a pause, right? And so that's why it starts with the P. So this is based on the incubation effect, right? Because in psychology, this refers to the process where stepping away from a problem or task allows your subconscious mind to continue working on it.

 So when you actively focus on something, your your conscious mind is limited by its working memory and cognitive biases. And taking a break gives your brain the freedom to explore alternative pathways and associations, which gives you new ideas in return when you eventually decide to edit it.

 and you go to Oh, always the out loud out loud test, right? Reading a script aloud is one of the easiest ways to catch awkward phrasing or unnatural flow. So, pretend you're delivering the script to an audience and if something doesn't sound right, you want to change it. And this works because it helps you identify sentences that are too long or overly complicated.

 For example, our company, which has been in the business of providing top quality, innovative solutions to clients for over 15 years, is uniquely positioned to leverage its extensive expertise. when you say it in one line, it feels chunky. And to say in one breath, but when you're reading it visually, it doesn't look terrible, right? It doesn't look terrible on the slide.

 When you revise it, for over 15 years, our company has delivered innovative solutions. So, you can see when I edit, I'm not just trying to replace words. Okay, how can I cut this down? What is not necessary that I can really just rephrase it? The revised version is clearer and easier to follow when read out loud. Work with tools, right? Use editing tools like Grammarly or Chad to clean up grammar and spelling mistakes, right? You can edit a prompt.

Hey, fix all grammar and spelling mistakes. These tools aren't perfect. They can help your scripts readability, right? So, really, it's like the first round check when you uh give it a chat GBT or you give it a Grammarly or what I personally like to use is claude. Um, makes it a lot easier.

 And why it works? Because these tools catch small errors that distract from your message, right? And they can suggest clearer phrasing for complex ideas. Um, I personally recommend that you use Hemingway. It's a great tool for keeping your writing stupid simple, right? Hemingway has this thing where it grades your writing according to its reading level.

 So if the writing is a grade 12 reading level, you know that it's a little bit too complex. So you want to keep it to fifth to seventh grade reading level in terms of the writing. And E is to evaluate the flow. So your script should flow logically from one point to the next. Right? Each sentence should guide the audience seamlessly to the next idea.

 So how do you check flow? Right? You want to see does each point connect naturally to the next? Right? Are transition smooth? is your argument or story building meaningfully towards something right you want to check for the flow of the script right and and this is also one of the major things that I really look out for right I'm thinking hey does one point link to another link to another link to another and um when you can see when I was uh reading the the sky script I was really thinking hey does does everything flow properly if it doesn't flow properly then I want to edit it so one common problem I see is script writers using too many filler words um or transitions, right? Um some filler words are next or let's dive into this or here's a harsh truth. All of these are filler and can be cut, right? When I think about writing a script or when I think about any writing, if it doesn't contribute to the main narrative, if it doesn't help drive a certain point home, can be cut, you can just completely remove it because it doesn't teach the viewer anything and it

doesn't move the story forward. You really really want to be super particular when you're editing it, right? You want to think about, hey, when if if there like there's an old man sitting over your shoulder yelling at you editing your script, ask, does every sentence have a purpose? Right? When you read a sentence, what is the purpose of it? Just like when I was breaking down hooks previously, and you can see every single line in the hook has a purpose, right? So, when you're evaluating flow, you're seeing all of these filler words. Does the filler words have any purpose? If the filler words doesn't have a purpose or it doesn't really aim to emphasize anything for the viewer, probably just completely cut it out. Right? So, this is one of the things that you want to be very very conscious of. Those transitions are boring and uh they can get repetitive fast if you keep repeating them over and over in the same script. You want to think of ways you can add transition points by adding insight, sharing info, etc. Example, bad flow, right? So if you say so that was everything you needed to know about code emailing next let's talk about code DMs kind of like a random transition right

very certain next doesn't really add anything right or like not a bad flow right your thumbnail is important now let's get talk about how to make great intros seems kind of dramatic but you can see when I was editing the sky script or the Instagram script previously you can see that there's actually a lot of these mistakes that you kind of make within your actual script this is confusing because there's no clear connection between thumbnails and intros why jump topics, right? When you read your own scripts, you're going to see a lot of these mistakes, right? Good flow, right? Thumbnails are the first thing viewers see, so they decide whether to click or not. But even with the perfect thumbnail, bad intro will lose in seconds. Let's talk about how to hook them with a killer intro. And see, transition is seamless, right? You wrap up a point and you transition to the next one. Next, thumbnails intros by showing how one leads to the other creates curiosity about the intro, keeps viewers engaged. Another example, bad flow, right? First, brainstorm your video topic. After that, write a script. Now, let's talk about call to action. Fuse rushed, right? One of the things when I talk about when you stack too many payoffs, right? You tell them, "Hey, do this then this and this and this then this." Stacking too many payoffs, not very good because leaves the viewer confused and you don't fully

explain something, right? You kind of just scratch it on the surface level. Feels so it feels rush. You skip steps, doesn't explain why these actions are important or how they fit together. So that's not how you want to write your script. So a good flow is, hey, you want to first brainstorm a topic that matches your audience's interest.

 And once you have a solid idea, write a script that brings your topic to life. Finally, finish your script with a strong call to action to guide viewers to the next step. So with each point, you fully develop it. Right? This just one sentence. It's not fully fully developed, but you can see the flow is already a lot stronger.

 You can see each step builds logically on the previous one, creating a clear process, right? Transitions once you have finally guide the audience through the steps without confusion. So another example, bad flow, right? It's hard to get viewers to stay past the first 10 seconds. Also, thumbnails are important for clicks, right? Pretty obvious.

 You jump between problems. Not good. If you say getting viewers to stay past the first 10 seconds is tough, but it starts before they even click, right? A strong thumbnail grabs their attention and a hook keeps it. Let's break down how to master both. So, you can see there's a clear flow here, right? Links to two ideas showing how one problem leads to another, and it feels seamless.

 It feels logical. It's also very easy to read, right? You can see kind of like the way that you read it is is just different because the ideas flow so easily and you can really only identify these mistakes and flow when I read it out loud. When I'm reading out out loud, it's a lot more obvious, right? But if you're just sitting there in your office and you're just like staring at the script, like you can't really get out these mistakes, right? It's much more difficult.

 So tips to create good flow, right? Use transitions, words like because, so then, next, and finally guide the audience through your ideas. So, first brainstorm your topic, then write your script. Finally, edit into something unforgettable. Explain why it matters, right? Don't just list steps. Explain how they connect, right? You need a good title, thumbnail, and hook.

 Good example, right? Your title grabs attention, your thumbnail gets a click, and your hook keeps them watching. These three elements work together to make your video irresistible. And then you want to think like a viewer, right? Ask yourself, if I didn't know anything about this, would this make sense? Or even better, if you have someone else that you can ask, hey, can you read this and let me know what you think? Is this valuable information? Um, I I ask that a lot to kind of my YouTube strategy friends, right? When I'm making videos on retention, when I'm making videos about script writing, is this good info to you, right? Is this something interesting that you watch? Is this a good script? If yes, then I will go record the video, right? If not, then I would just refine it, right? And and ask them what their feedback is. Put yourself in the viewer's shoes. If I didn't know anything about this, would this make any sense? because if it doesn't, then you're going to have to rewrite the script. And R is to record your check, right? Record yourself reading the script using Loom or similar tool or you can use your camera, right? Watch your delivery and then you can see issues uh that you didn't catch while

writing, right? Some of the top creators that I know will really sit down, record a script for an hour, and re-watch the footage, right? And when they rewatch the footage, if they're not super happy with their delivery or they notice certain parts are awkward, they'll go back to the script, they'll edit it, and then they'll re-record it, right? Because they want to make sure that it's the best quality piece of content that they can post out.

 YouTube videos take a long time to edit, takes a long time to post. So really, with your script, you want to make sure that it's the best possible state that you can have it to be. So hearing the script aloud shows whether it sounds natural. So watching a performance highlights parts that drag a few disconnected.

 So that's the power method. I'm going to give you guys my full editing framework and um this is more so kind of like to think about it high level and really the best way you can get good is number one having this information and number two actually implementing it in your videos right when you're recording your next videos when you're editing your next videos actually sit down and edit it and use these frameworks that I'm about to give you. Cool deal. Okay, let's go.

 So, hooks, right? Your hook is the first impression, right? If it's weak, your audience won't stick around. We already talked about that. Ask yourself in your hook, right? Does the first line validate the title and thumbnail, right? The part of the framework, right? Have you set clear expectations for what the video will deliver? And is there a curiosity gap that makes viewers want to keep watching? If the answer is yes to all three, then good.

 You've done a good job with your hook, right? See this this this hook, you clicked on this video because you want X. Let's get into it, right? Confirm the video matches the title, right? introduce an unclosed loop kind of like using the framework right when you edit your hook does it follow the framework but there's one mistake almost everyone makes with X set the tone and then go into the body right when you edit the body it's where you deliver the value when you're editing the body right are you building towards the next step have you explained why your audience should care right within the point as I said it's more important that the audience understands why something is important and actually how to implement it right because when they understand uh why doing your taxes is important uh then you do your taxes, right? If I just tell you, hey, this is how you do your taxes, you're not going to be bothered to do it. But when you know why it's important to you do your taxes, then they'll actually go and do it, right? So, you want to meet your audience where they're at. Number three is, did you include actionable tips or clear examples? Okay. Number four, are the transitions smooth? Right? Are the open loops smooth? Guiding viewers towards your point logically. So, you want to ask yourself these four questions when you're editing your body.

This is an example, right? You need good thumbnails. They're important. It's bad. versus a strong thumbnail increases clicks by 30%. For example, Mr. Beast uses bright colors and clear text. Let's break down why that works. It's just like expanding it a little more, right? You don't want to keep things super surface level.

 When I read a lot of scripts, if it's usually in the,000 to,500 word range, um, unless that's super intended and you've written many scripts before, it's usually because you don't go in-depth enough. So, we want to make sure to go in-depth for the viewer. And then your ultra call to action, right? the last chance to guide your audience to the to the next step, right? Do you have a single clear call to action? Do you link the call to action to the video's content? Have you promised a transformation or benefit for clicking on the next video? So, this is the curiosity, right? Is there a gap, right? Is there a transformation for clicking on the next video? So, now that you know how to write a script that grabs attention, but writing is just one part of the process, click here to learn how to turn your script into a viral video. There you go. Right? So, it's the three-part process. hook, curiosity, action that you want to follow pretty much when when you're writing any call to action, right? It's the exact same thing. So, let's talk about common mistakes to avoid before we go into live editing a couple scripts. Mistakes overthinking the first draft. So, it's spending hours rewriting the first 100 words, right? Really, it slows down the

process of writing and kills creativity. Really, write quickly. Write the first draft quickly and then focus on refining. Another mistake is using jargon, right? You want to edit out jargon and then skipping the hook, right? starting with ir irrelevant or boring details, right? So all of these you want to avoid, right, when you're editing, right? You want to look out for these.

 Another common mistake is rushing the editing process, right? So it's skipping steps like checking flow or reading aloud and then it's it's ignoring flow, right? It's jumping between unrelated points without transitions. So that's just like not reading the script out loud, not really being super particular, not being super strict on the flow of the script because if the flow of the script isn't there.

Final tips for editing, right? Cut the fluff. If a word of sentence doesn't add value, cut it. Right? I'm a big fan of just cutting, cutting, cutting, cutting. Having shoulder scripts, right? But the value per minute is much higher. Big fan of that. Focus on the audience. Right? Tailor your script to the needs audience needs and the level of understanding that they have.

 And then you want to simplify, simplify, simplify, right? Your goal is to be clear, not to be complex. Right? You don't want to be clever. You want to make sure that your content is as clear as it can be. Your first draft doesn't have to be amazing. It just needs to exist, right? And hopefully if you follow these principles, you'll create script that keep audiences coming back for more.

 Go write the rough draft and then edit it into something incredible. So that's the slides for editing. Now, we're going to go into live editing. This is probably the most valuable part that when I do live calls within my community, um people love seeing me edit it live and me explain my full thought process.

 So, um let's go and edit some scripts live. I have a couple people who submitted their scripts. I'm going to edit it live, explain my thought process, and let's do it. Okay, let's have a look at the script. So, the title of the script is why is everyone moving to Poland? So, editor notes in red.

 So, um editor notes is really important because um usually when editors edit, right, they usually just have the voice over. They usually just have the talking head um and they have the script. And you know, there's certain things that you want to have in the script that you want the editor to know so that it's a lot clearer.

 They kind of know what to specifically edit for. Editor notes, super duper important. That's one of the big things that you want to think of. And we're going to cover that in story boarding um in one of the last and final modules that I think will be super useful for you to have. Okay. So, before we get into that, let's let's let's edit a couple scripts.

 So, why is everyone moving to Poland? Let's see the hook. 1 million. That is the number of people who have moved to Poland since 2020. To put it into perspective, it is like moving the entire population of Birmingham to one place. What could possibly edit this right? What could possibly be driving this sudden shift? While other economies are struggling, Poland doesn't look like it's slowing down anytime soon.

 Since April this year, Poland recorded the largest annual economic growth at 4%, greater than Cypress at 3.7% and ahead of Spain at 2.9%. This stable economy is creating many opportunities for local and international talent. Companies need you. Whether you work companies need you whether you work in transport, the IT sector, consumer goods, service industries, as well as other businesses.

One of these many jobs could have your name on it. Here's how I know this to be true. One of the immediate things that comes to mind when I'm reading this, it's I'm trying to understand um what kind of a viewer would watch this video and uh what are they trying to get out of this video, right? Kind of in the hook, we say, okay, we hook of 1 million.

 That is number of people who moved to Poland since 2020, which is great. We don't really here we're kind of just like describing the phenomena and it's not too clear what the viewer will get out of the video. Immediately when I see the title, I want to diagnose what is the type of viewer that will click on the video and what is the type of audience that the YouTube channel is trying to build, right? And there's a couple of people that could possibly want to click on this, right? So, uh, possible target audience. Let me just write it down. Uh, people wanting to move to Poland. Uh, so like maybe like digital nomads or this could be like more documentary style. Um, but I think more often than not, it's like, hey, people wanting to move to Poland or people considering people wanting or considering to move to Poland, right? And it's like usually like digital nomads. Um, and um, and like there's like part of that is like, oh, like kind of like the incentive for them wanting to watch this video. It's like, hey, right, these are the things that I want to think about when I'm moving to Poland. um kind of like describing the overall phenomena

because um when I'm moving to Poland, I also want to understand what the landscape looks like, right? I assume that's the audience that it wants to build. It would be a little bit odd for me to kind of see like a documentary style of hey, just like answering the question of like why everyone is moving to Poland.

 I think there needs to be something in it for the viewer. When I think of this, okay, how can I create something that's in it for the viewer in the hook so that the viewer wants to continue watching, right? And um this is just like kind of my hunch from seeing the title. And this is once again like you have to be very clear the type of audience you want to build and the specific audience uh and and and the specific uh title that you want to have and kind of who's going to click on the video.

 To put that into perspective, it is like moving the entire population of Birmingham to one place. Um now I'm like, hey, is this is this super relatable? So before I even like edit the script, right, I like you know there's like certain small edits I want to make, but I want to make comments immediately, right? So is it super relatable? So let's see what could be possibly driving this certain shift.

 So here I can immediately set expectations, right? So I can immediately set expectations for what this video is is uh going to talk about. I wanted to investigate hundreds of thousands of global talent are moving to Poland. So you can just say in this video I want to investigate why hundreds of thousands of global talent are moving to Poland and what could possibly um these two are kind of saying the same thing.

 I want to investigate why hundreds of thousands of global talent and whether you should consider Poland as a place to settle down. And again, you can transition, right? While while other economies are struggling right here, we kind of read this. I think this is fine. One of these many jobs could have your name on it.

 Here's how I know this to be true. The country has issued 2 million work visas over the past 3 years. A survey that was carried out recently found that 35% of employers plan to expand their workforce and 42% intend to maintain current staffing levels. Don't just take it from the stats. Let's talk to John.

 For example, here you can be like, "Hey, John works as XYZ, right?" So that way uh or give him a profile. And the reason we want to do this is because we because we want to develop relatability with the audience, right? If they know who he is, they can possibly relate to them and that could possibly improve retention.

 Back home, he was barely making ends meet. Now he's tucking away half his paycheck every month. I've faced more in the past year than in the 5 years before that. He told me this due to many factors. One of which is that rent prices in London are 170% higher than in Warsaw. Living costs for one person in London estimated 3,400 1780 in Warsaw making London 93% more expensive.

 In Poland you can live a comfortable lifestyle without the financial strain often associated with living in major European cities. Also let's talk about what Poland offers to people just moving there. So like this is like what I would consider filler, right? What what type of support you get and usually one hack is like these questions, right? Questions can usually be turned into sentences.

 Usually we don't use rhetorical sentences. Uh we don't use rhetorical questions unless they're like really really rhetorical. Like for example, something like this isn't really rhetorical, right? What type of support do you get? There's an answer to that. So I wouldn't consider it a rhetorical question.

 A rhetorical question is when you ask a question and um there isn't an answer to it, right? Or the answer is obvious to it. That's a rhetorical question. In this case, it's easy to overuse these questions. Uh when you think about writing, uh write like you speak is an important principle in writing and uh that's something that's often missed.

 So, everyone will like usually ask these questions. So, I I I wouldn't I wouldn't do it. So, I I mean just mock this, right? And I would probably cancel this. Maybe I just go into suggestion mode. I'll just cancel this. Polish language schools are offered to newcomers where English-speaking medical facilities are available.

 Assistance also given to arrange medical insurance. This leads me to my next point about embassies. Polish language schools are offered to newcomers where English speaking medical facilities are available. So you can see here it's kind of a gap, right? So here this point needs to be fully expanded on.

 Right here when when you look at the script, it's like 1,300 words. So 1,000 words is probably about like a 7 minute video which is a pretty short video. I'm not sure why why people are moving to Poland. Um, when I think of a video like that, kind of like in the research phase, I'd imagine this video to be about 15 minutes long where we fully break down why people are moving to Poland.

 Is this really paying it off right now? Uh, right now we're kind of just saying, oh, like Poland has all of these facilities. I'd like to see in this video is what people cannot Google, right? what is stuff that people aren't really seeing in Poland that is making people choose Poland over other countries.

 So we went over one thing which is the living cost right. So the living cost can uh the living cost is a big differentiating factor right here we're looking at the support that they get right assistance also given to arrange medical insurance so this is like kind of broad right so this is very broad very vague I think this is where there's like a missing in the research right you can go a little bit more in depth polish language schools are also offered to newcomers so like so what so like what so what are you trying to say here when you offer Polish language schools to newcomers what does that mean for people coming in. That means that unlike people going to like let's say Germany, right? If you don't know German, then it's going to be very difficult for you to navigate. If you go to Poland, right, there's Polish language schools so that you can learn Polish much easier and you can assimilate. It's it's it's really important to answer the question of so what, right? When you're writing these scripts, it's always asking yourself so what, so what, so what, so what, right? When you make a claim, so what? Make a claim, so what? Make a claim. So what?

Right? And this is going to be a common theme when you're editing your script or when you're editing other people's scripts. You you'll read the sentence and be like, "Okay, so what what is the significance of this?" And you want to explain a point in its full significance before you jump into talking about something else.

 Because if you just don't do that, there will be a gap in the knowledge, right? There will be a gap in the specific message that you want to give. And in this case, you can kind of see that there is like a big gap here. and and this might just be a case of a gap in the research that you definitely want to look at. So this leads me to my next point about embassies where the home countries offer support and help and where contact information can be found.

 So what does Poland offer you in terms of housing and transport? So once again this can be turned into a statement, right? Turned into a statement. We've already covered Warsaw. Let's talk about beautiful coastal city in the north of Poland. Gdansk uh Dansk, I don't know how you pronounce it, right? You could get a cozy flat that would set you back D.

 which just $700 a month and not just in Jud uh cities all over Poland offer excellent deals on housing for utilities you'll be looking at around 540 like whatever the currency is transportation and then picture disc you have just finished work and your friends have invited you to a nice dinner and restaurant luckily you know you can go without breaking the bank so no one really writes with picture discre AI and there's a lot of things like once you start writing with AI you will kind of get a good sense of what feels like lazy writing, right? And picture this is one of the things that feels like lazy writing. So, um I I I don't want to harp on this script for too long. I want to go over and look at a couple other scripts, but really when you're looking at this, once again, main things to look out for is um number one, the AI writing. Number two, when you have questions, you can turn that into statements. So, for example, in terms of housing and transport, Poland, Poland is blah blah blah, right? And then you can turn that into a statement. And also

fully expanding on points. When you read a sentence, so what? Read a sentence. So what? Expand, expand, expand, expand until it's fully explained. And then you jump into another point. When you don't do this right, that's that's when you get a video that's about 1,300 words, 6 7 minutes long.

 Really, ideally, you hit the 10 to 15 minute range. um with these kind of explainer videos, longer videos equals to longer watch time equals to higher RPMs, right? It means you make more uh per thousand views and if you're selling a product, it really builds bigger trusted scale, right? So that's also what you want to think about when um when you're writing these scripts, when when you're editing these scripts.

Let's have a look at another script before we uh transition to talking about storyboarding. Okay, let's look back at the sky script, right? 55 calls with less than 7K followers. Um, I want to edit one of the payoffs and kind of explain my thought process cuz I think um, this guy isn't a bad writer.

 I think there's a couple things that we can learn. Um, he's just learning YouTube script writing. There's a couple things that we can learn um, in terms of the flow of logic or the certain examples that we can bring in. And also this is a good script to look at because a lot of you guys watching will run educational channels and yeah like the logic is the most difficult part kind of like packaging your thoughts in a way that's interesting to the viewer and something that the viewer wants to keep watching. So let's have a look at this here. He talks about packaging, right? And to get viewers to commit to watching your video, you need to ma first master the art of packaging. Your video needs to be compelling enough within the first 3 seconds to beat out the cat videos. degenerate memes or the only fans girls. And this goes beyond just stealing viral hooks. If it were really that simple where you can just steal viral hooks and guarantee a viral video, I'd be doing it. I'd be doing it. But the problem is you're not going to have occupy. So there's some grammar. You're not going to you're not going to be top of mind for your viewer, right? We already

said uh occupy mental real estate. So here we want to vary the word choice, right? You'll live in one blob with your competitors. Yo, in order to hook the viewer into your video while standing out, you have to understand the psychology behind the hook. It's what it's what I call the packaging.

 This will make this will 100% make or break your video. So, a couple like ground errors here. Make or break your video. Let's say you were looking for a car and walked into a Volk Volkswagen car dealership. They only had two cars you had to choose from. Both cars have the single engine, a nasty V12, but one of the engines is in an ugly Volkswagen Golf. The other is in a 911 uh GT3 RS.

Not too familiar with cars. Chances are, unless you're some psycho or have no taste, you take the GT3 RS. Got my wings out. Okay, some humor there. In the same scenario, you have this really unique and game-changing insight. But if you package it incorrectly, no one's going to stay long enough to experience the benefits because the packaging of your value will matter. So simple edits here.

Your hook is a sentence you say. The packaging is the psychology behind what you say. To find the perfect packaging, it's all about understanding what your avatar is actually thinking about. Let's go back to the video I shared earlier. The hook for this video was originally, "This guy used the Snapchat method to make $15 million a year at 22.

" Because I've seen a lot of videos that did well that start with this guy made XYZ. But because I'm in online business niche, I knew the memes happening at any given time and I knew one of them was the coaches coaching coaches, which is what Sam Millsap did. So I swapped that hook out for this coach that coaches your favorite coaches coach used, this is a mouthful, used a Snapchat content strategy to make 15 million at 22.

 It's my second best performing in this page right now. It's brought awareness to a huge amount of online business owners. If you look at the comments and lo and behold, one of the top top comments was that meme. Without the right packaging, the viewer would have never given me permission to talk about the value because they'll just scroll off.

 And that means which they won't watch my and if they scroll off, they won't watch my upcoming videos either. Meaning I won't book any that means I wouldn't wouldn't have booked any calls. Okay, so this is pretty interesting over here. There's no immediate problem with this, but there is also a logic problem.

 I'm not sure if that's a sense that you get, but by the end of this, I still don't really understand the difference between hook and the packaging, right? What he's saying is that the packaging is the psychology um and the hook is the words that you say, right? And then he kind of brings um the idea of the GT3.

 I think I think one of the main improvements is you can say, "Hey, right. Uh unless you you're some psycho or have no taste, right? It's it's less about taste um but it's more about like the pricing, right? So like one of the things that I can say here it's like hey instead of talking about picking one you can say because um uh because the 911 GT3 RS is packaged better they can charge however much it is 200,000 for it.

 Um while the same engine in this case, right, the same the same inside while the same engine packaged in an ugly Volk wagon Golf only goes for let's say $10,000 or the same engine only goes for $10,000, right? Well here you can see like the big discrepancy in terms of the value and then you can say here packaging is everything because the packaging of your insight right you say inside is more important before a hook is a sentence you say the packaging is the psychology behind what you say to I find to find the perfect packaging it's it's all about it's about understanding what your avatar is what your avatar is thinking about in the present moment. Let's go back to the video I shared earlier, right? The hook for this video was originally, this guy used Snapchat method to make $15 million at 22 because I've seen a lot of videos that did well with this guy. I know the memes happening at any given time. This coach

that coaches your favorite coach's coach, right? And the ended up performing very well. So here I think one of the comments is that you want to be specific with your content, with your writing, right? Specificity wins. If you can give actual numbers of number of booked calls or revenue generated from the reel or certain views.

 So you see broad awareness, right? Broad awareness is kind of broad. Broad awareness is broad. Be specific. That's also one of the things that I'm editing for, right? How specific uh of the words do I actually use? Right? How specific can I be? Lo behold, one of the top comments here. I'm kind of just telling the viewer, hey, right, without the right packaging, it's it's not going to be good, right? So, really, we want to be a lot more actionable with our content, especially when we're making educational content. We we don't just want to tell the viewer blah blah blah blah blah, right? We want to be actually actionable so that the viewer can take the information that you gave them and apply it and get results within the next 24 hours, right? That's one of the good metrics um of a strong payoff. In the case of entertainment videos, the payoff will be the emotional payoff. In this case, it's the actionable step that they can take with the new information that they have to go apply it, right? And if you can just tell them directly what it is, that will be even better. So really just high level looking at it, we have the why this is important, right? We have the why this is important and then we have

uh the what it is, right? With an example. Here we're missing the how, right? So without the right packaging, the viewer would have never given me permission to talk about the value because they'll just scroll off. And if they scroll off, they won't watch my upcoming videos either. Meaning I wouldn't have booked any calls.

 So I'm going just make a comment. So if you want to find the best packaging for your videos, follow these three steps, right? And then you and you want to break it down, right? So I'm just going to make a comment here to edit it. Hey, add an actionable step for the packaging of your videos.

 You want to make it so that the viewer can take this information that packaging is important and immediately apply it in the in their videos and get results. That's literally it. There you go. So, let's edit this call to action. Right now, if you stay this far, you'll learn how to use these three principles.

 value principles he spelled wrongly right value to get recurring watchers build goodwill proof so here he kind of just recaps it so here one of the comments I said is delete the recap you don't need to recap for the viewer because the viewer if they need a recap they'll rewatch the video and when they rewatch the video that's when you get longer watch time right but if you recap it that's kind of telling the viewer that hey the video is about to end and you should just click off right now because the video is about to end but no you don't want to do that you want to immediately rehook the viewers's attention after your last point and then transition to the call to action. Right? So, I would delete this. That that's that was my advice. But what I didn't tell you is that this is really only the tip is that this is that what I just shared with you, what I just shared with you is only the tip of the iceberg of becoming a creative founder with 24/7 lead generation and nurture machine that pumps out warm ready to buy leads and all of your marketing efforts. So you can see here, this is a super long

sentence that spans three lines. But wait, I didn't tell you something. What I just shared with you is only the tip of the iceberg of becoming a creator founder who can out leads out ready to buy leads in 24 uh while you're asleep right here. I can like just summarize that, right? Just cut the sentence in half.

 That's why instead of I actually, right, that's why I made a full masterclass video that breaks down, you don't just want to say cover, right? Breaks down the entire content creation process. I've legit checked out all of YouTube. This is Moana's voice, so that's fine. Telling you, nobody nobody is giving you the sauce, and it's right here waiting for you.

 Click over here to watch it. But until then, I'll see you guys next time. There you go. Right. So here, if we just delete this, right, we made this a lot more readable, made it a lot more concise, right? That makes the call to action a lot more effective just because it's easier to read.

 And um we just we just do a direct call to action. So there you go. That's a full tutorial on how to edit your video. But once you've edited the video, right, you've recorded the video, now you want to send it over to the editor, but the editor doesn't know how to edit it, right? They don't really know what to specifically do with it.

 And that's why we're going to talk about storyboarding. And storyboarding is also a really important part of script writing because as a script writer um or you know when you give it to your editor, you're pretty much the director of the video, right? You're the director um and you're the producer of the video and it's your job to direct the direction of the editing by giving them clips, letting them know what visuals to add and that way the script can complement the visuals.

 So that's exactly what we're going to talk about. So stick around for that. Storyboarding in YouTube script writing is when you add notes in your script for the editor. So it's basically a guide to help the editor visualize your video. So whether you're writing scripts for yourself or you're writing scripts for a client, it's important to storyboard because that way the editor will have an idea of what clips to put in, what visuals to put in.

 if you have a certain vision in terms of how it's meant to be edited. This especially for like documentary scripts, but also for like educational scripts, right? If you refer to a study, um you want the editor to be able to pull up the study and then have like the yellow highlight if that's kind of the visual that you want to have.

 So, it's important to give the editor direction and that is what storyboarding does. So, these notes explain how scenes should look, what emotions they should show and what clips or effects to use. So you can see here right for the edit do the exact opposite edit of the intro right instead of clouds and halo do hell background and demon thorns in their head right do an edit where the camera falls sideways and uncovers the seven heavenly virtues similar to 38 right so you can see here it's sometimes really in depth but it doesn't always have to be super in-depth kind of depends on the video so I'm going to talk about you know how to storyboard different videos how I think about it how to collect these clips and how to make your life of the editor a lot easier and this will help you post videos a lot faster, right? So, a good storyboard includes, right, notes about editing and effects, right? Zoom in on the subject during this line. All of that links to examples or references, right? Clip, clip, clip. You can see here, play this clip here, play this clip here, play this clip here, play this clip here. That's all part of the research, all part of the script writing process. Also like ideas for pacing, right? Play investigative

sounding music before we even start storyboarding. How does this improve your videos, right? Keeping things clear, right? Everyone knows what to do. Editors don't have to guess, right? So, keep things clear. It saves a ton of time instead of going back and forth on revisions.

 Saves you a lot of headache, right? It makes the videos engaging and um it helps you scale your workflow, right? You can focus on ideas and scripting while the editors handle the execution of the video. So, think of storyboarding as the pre-editing, right? Every second planned now saves hours later in terms of going back and forth. I'm going to give a quick overview.

Storyboarding isn't a super complex uh science, but storyboarding is super important. I do want to talk about how to make your storyboards simple and effective. There are three major steps that you need to follow, right? You start with research and you go into scripting and you go into storyboarding, right? And the reason you need to follow this workflow is because it is the fastest and the most efficient way to storyboard your scripts.

 Let's break it down. So the research is starts when when you're making a video, you need to find certain reference clips, sound effects or transitions before you start script writing. This is less so for educational videos and more so for like documentary videos, right? when you want to reference certain clips or uh usually when I do uh my YouTube script writing breakdowns, I'll say, "Hey, this uh this creator did this, right?" And then they'll play a clip of it.

 I also want to have that. So that happens within the research stage. So you can find clips and references in many ways. You can go to Google, you can go to Wikubia, you can go to Reddit, you can go to YouTube, right? And here's a couple pro tips. Google is used to find clips or images searching keywords, right? Wikubia is for celebrities, right? YouTubers.

Reddit is for to see opinions and trends and uh you can also find clips there, right? And YouTube is to find B-roll or example clips. YouTube's also really great place um to find clips and yeah, make a list of all the clips you want to use from those platforms and um yeah, add links to them so that it's easy to find the clips and certain timestamps too.

 And later I'll show you a tool you can use to do this for you. And with these clips, you can start visualizing and scripting out your video. And yeah, when you're scripting, start off the content, right? focus on developing the content narrative, right? Actual script is what you want to focus on. Um, and then later on you can write your hook or explanation clearly uh before thinking about your effects.

 So the storyboarding is I talk about this at the last step cuz really this is after editing the full script where you'll add certain annotations for the editor, right? Try your best to implement the clips that you found into the overall story of your script. That way it'll be easier for you to add clips.

 So here's how you can add clips in the most effective way. I like to storyboard my videos using the VRCT framework, which stands for visuals, references, clips, and time codes, right? And this is how you use them to your full potential. You want to have all of these with visuals, right? You want to revisit the script to include transitions, references, and clips ideas, right? And here have an example, right? Add fade to black after this line or use slow motion shot here.

References, right? any links to videos or images, clips, so if there's clips you want to have, and write timestamps to guide the editor on when and where to add effects or transitions. Usually, you would have visuals, references, clips, and time codes. You want to have all of these time codes especially, right? It's the worst when you just add a video and don't give the specific time code.

 Spend a little bit of time, right, sourcing the specific clips, adding certain time codes so that your editor can save a bunch of time when he's editing. So, I recommend you try to add as many visuals, references, clips, and time codes to your video as possible, right? That's super ideal.

 Saves your editor a bunch of time. It's pretty easy for most script writers to storyboard their videos wrong, right? So, here are the most common mistakes that you can make and how you can avoid them. Mistake number one, too many details, right? That means you you overwhelm the editor with unnecessary information, right? Usually, the editor might have their own creative direction.

 You give them too many details, hard for them to know what to do, right? No context, right? Vague notes make it hard for editors to know what you want. Uh copyright problems, right? Using unlicensed clips or music can also get your video taken down. Ugoring your editor, right? Means you miss out on valuable expertise.

 You have all these mistakes. How here's how you can avoid these mistakes with too many details, right? Script writers might believe that the more you write the better, but that's not always the case, right? So notes that are too long, you'll just waste you and your editor's time, right? So don't don't have a note that's too long.

 just give them the information that they need and they'll do the rest. Uh you don't want to make it impossible for your editor to have their own autistic integrity, right? If you have a good editor who knows what they're doing, you want to give them the freedom to be able to make the videos and edit the videos in a way that they think is best cuz they're the editor you're not.

 They probably have some sort of expertise here. You're forcing them to follow your instructions instead of letting the editor do their job. The best way to avoid this mistake is to keep notes concise and only include what's essential. So we can cut that original example into this. Right? So just much shorter, much more concise.

 No context, right? And even bigger problem if is if you're too vague, right? So there's one end too many details. The other is like no context, right? Make the edit better just makes no sense. You have to balance between making your notes concise and helpful without overdoing it.

 So once again, we always fall back to the framework, right? Visuals, references, clips, time codes. So focus on these four when you're storyboarding, right? Anything more than this is fluff and anything less is too vague. Another mistake is copyright problems, right? One thing to always remember when you're looking for clips is to avoid copyrighted clips and music, right? That's usually bad news cuz uh that could lead to demonetization of this specific video and you don't get adsense from you. You don't want that. So using clips and music without permission might lead to your video being copyright claimed and might lead to your video losing monetization or worse getting blocked. And you can avoid this problem by using copyright free resources and double-checking usage rights. And you can do this by using Google's copyright match tool. The last mistake is ignoring your editor, right? This is probably the worst mistake you can make as a script writer or, you know, if you're a business owner, you're doing the video production because it wastes both your time and your money. If you pay for an editor but end up ignoring them and try to control everything about your video's edit, right, your video, your editors talking to a wall, you end up missing out on valuable expertise and you start to stretch yourself too thin um when you try to do everything yourself. So, yeah,

that's everything that you need to know about storyboarding really. uh visuals, references, time codes. You want to have all of that VRCT and uh I'm going to show you one of my sample scripts uh that I've written that I think is storyboarded pretty well. Um it's a little bit of more of a complex video.

So, there was a little bit more storyboarding. I kind of want to show you what that looks like and what you really want to look out for when you're storyboarding, right? So, let's look at that right now. So, here I have this video that I've referenced, I think probably once in this video, right? How Imagi made $40 million from one YouTube video.

 So, the reason this video needed to be storyboarded pretty well is because we usually transition um between the talking head of me and then clips from his video, right? So, talking head of me and then clips of his video and then we break it down. So, it needs to be very clear how to storyboard it. So, um here I just want to give you a high level overview.

 We're not going to spend too much time on this here. Here you can see and because I went I want I want the private jet 2. I spent three weeks slaving away at my computer to figure out how he did it. So all you have to do to become Iangazi demon mode, right? This is like uh here like change my voice demon mode is to watch this video, right? And then here you have the video and the graph and this is the video that I'm talking about.

 So you unblur the video here. There you go. And then blah blah blah. So here here this is where we transition between the actual script um and uh and the clips. So it all starts with number one brainwash and then here I'm put in bracket right pause on screen fade into the video right with echoey flashback aesthetic right so look we're entering a new era everything is changing the way we buy the way we work the way we live and so does the way that people do business right and then here I have the clip with the time stamp right so it's equals one and then establish premise and then press play so this is like the play effect button and then here I have the clip again right that I want to play here it's timestamped because it's equals 9 so it knows to start at the 9 seconds here. 9 seconds with 10 words. He grabs your attention and here I with flashback graphic Iman saying right we're doing this like flashback graphic flashback graphic flashback graphic so that uh they know exactly what to look at right here we have the clips that's specifically what he's looking at look at the clips look at the clips so if there's certain parts that you want to be more specific in terms of how you want the edit to come

out then you want to specify it to the editor right if not in this case I have a good editor I've worked with this editor for a long time. So, I kind of trusted him to, hey, you can just go out and like do your own thing with this edit and um I I wouldn't be too super fussed about it, right? But if it's a newer editor and you're trying to give him direction, uh or you don't quite trust your editor and if you if your editor is working on your channel, um you should trust your editor. Um then you do need to give him a little bit more direction or if you have certain vision of how you want it to be edited, then you should give him that direction, right? What you definitely don't want to do is you don't want to just like ignore your editor or you don't want to give him too little information. In this case, all that I needed um you know, I've worked with this editor for a long time. All that I needed was to give timestamps in terms of the clips. Make it very clear, right? Obviously, me taking the specific timestamps and um and getting the YouTube links for that takes a little bit of time. That just saves him a bunch of time, right? So, like here, this is the transcript of it of of this specific time stamp. So he

knows exactly where to start and where to stop, right? And that really makes it way easier for him uh to edit this video, right? So it's just one example of how you want to storyboard. This is a little bit more high level here. If you have stuff that you want to give direction to your editor, it's important to Right.

 Additionally, what you can do is you can record a loom over uh over your script just talking about, hey, I want it to be edited like this. Hey, I want it to be edited like this. That's also a simpler way to storyboard it. Um, and that way the editor can like watch a video side by side while editing so he knows kind of like what visuals.

 A step up to this is if you want to draw how you want it to be uh edited, that could also work. Um, storyboarding not super complicated. Uh, don't fret too much about it, but it's super duper important to communicate with your editor and make sure that you know he knows how you want to execute the video.

 I think I think that's super important. That's storyboarding. And now that we've talked about storyboarding, uh, last module that I want to talk about is how you can use AI to script your videos to really simplify the workflow and, um, how I specifically use AI when I'm writing my scripts.

 It's something that I've been diving into for the past couple months. Something that I think that I'm pretty knowledgeable about at this point that I want to share with you, some of the things that I'm looking at, some of the things that I'm thinking about when I'm writing scripts. So, let's get right into it. Finally, we can talk about AI.

 And the reason um I decided to put this AI section all the way at the back is because AI isn't super important when you are trying to write a YouTube script. There's a lot of talk about, you know, how can I use AI to replace my script writer? How can I use AI to do copyrightiting? How can I use AI to write my emails? those don't really take into consideration the context that you need in order to prompt AI.

 If you want to be able to use AI efficiently, you need to be able to answer two questions. You need to know what a good script looks like. That way, when the AI prints out something for you, you're able to assess, okay, is it good or is it bad? If you're not able to tell, right? Right? If you're not able to tell with a sophisticated eye, if you're not sure what a good YouTube script looks like, like I'm able to tell, there's actually no point in me giving you the prompts in me telling you how to specifically do it, how to specifically prompt it, because uh when I switch the context a little bit, when I tell you, hey, write for this other channel, hey, change the topic for this, you won't know what to feed it. You won't know what questions to give it. And worst of all, you won't know whether the output that it gives you is good or not, right? And then if you have a semi okay output, you go record it and the video doesn't perform well and you're like, "Hey, why doesn't the video perform well?" Well, it's because you don't know what good looks like. So, it's super duper important that you understand all of the previous

sections before you decided, hey, I'm going to write with AI. If you don't know what a good script looks like, if you don't know what a retention optimized script looks like, if you don't know the specific frameworks to write a script, if you don't know how to write payoffs, how to write hooks, there is no point in you understanding this AI section, right? So, uh if this this this video will be timestamped and if you clicked all the way to this AI section just to learn about AI, suggest you go understand every single part before this and the actual steps to take before you learn how to write with AI. Okay, cool. Go back. Don't watch this part. So, for those of you who actually watched from start to finish, let's talk about kind of how I think about writing with AI and the specific use cases that I have for it. So, as I said before, when you want to write with AI, you need to understand what good looks like. And number two, you have to understand what questions to ask it. Because there's never going to be a world where you can oneshot prompt and you'll be able to get a full YouTube script, right? there'll never be a world

you really need to refine it. You need to ask it the right questions in order to get the best output. Okay, so that's high level how you want to think about uh script writing of AI. In terms of the tools that I use, uh Plexity is really great for research. Um many people use for research.

 It can help browse the web. It does deep research for you. I use Plexity whenever I need to do research, especially when I'm writing for new niches that I'm not super familiar with. can get me a bunch of research papers, articles, when I'm writing documentaries. Perplexity is really, really great.

 And if you're not sure what to prompt perplexity, one of the biggest hacks that you can use when you're deciding to prompt AI and you're not sure what to prompt it, you can just ask it, what should I prompt you with, right? And then you can just feed it back that prompt. So, Publexity is really great for research.

 In terms of writing, I like to use Claude. Claude is something that I found the most success with. I know a couple people using Gemini to actually write the script. Uh Gemini is possibly another option. I haven't tested it, but what I've written so far is with Claude and it's found me uh really great success in terms of writing good scripts and helping me do brand research.

 Claude just understands brand voice um at its most, right? And brand voice is also a really important thing because kind of the one of the big problems with writing with AI is that it doesn't sound like you, right? And if it doesn't sound like you, you can't record it and you can't use it. So I think that's something that Claude really understands well for now, right? As of recording of this video, May 2025, Claude is probably the best model in terms of writing.

 And I think many people will agree with me on that, but uh that's the case for now. And um I actually don't really use AI to fully write scripts, right? Unless I have like full prompts. They're really you can't just use one prompt to like oneshot the whole script. What I like to do is to write it in chunks, right? And I want to give you um two specific use cases that you can have uh for your script, right? And um without just giving you prompts really my goal with kind of this section is to give you the thinking frameworks in order to actually prompt the AI to actually get it have a good output. The main use case that I have for Claude is that I wanted to understand my brand voice right and really Claude's really good. What you can do is once again you can just go to YouTube. Let's say you go to my channel. You can get the transcript of a couple of my videos. Let's say you get the transcript for this. You Let's say you get a transcript for this video. Um, here you can just copy the transcript. Oh, no. You can just copy the transcript and you can put

it in here. You can copy the transcript for a couple videos here. And you just want to feed it examples of videos that you've written. And if you don't already have um scripts that you've written, right, and you're like starting a completely new channel, if you have PDFs, if you have newsletters uh that you've written, um that's also good to like feed it.

 And then you want to ask it to analyze your brand voice, right? So here I've fed it three transcripts. Then you just want to be able to talk to it, right? Um the best thing that you can do is, you know, you want to give it specific information, right? specific actions on what to do.

 And then you also want to give it um certain parameters, right? So, so like parameters would be like, hey, write in a fifth grade reading level um use simple language, you know, stuff like that. So that it can kind of know what to do or hey, give me the output in this format, right? So that it knows exactly what to do. Now, number one use case that I use it for is the brand voice, right? So I you want to use it to extract the brand voice.

 So that way when I give it another topic it'll actually understand the brand voice and it'll be able to write it in that. So let's say you give it this right it's like hey um I want you to extract a JSON profile. So JSON profile basically it uh it's a way of storing data right. So um so this is an easy way.

 You can just get a document with the exact JSON profile and it will extract the brand voice. And this is something that you can feed back to Claude and it'll immediately know my brand voice. So I want you to extract the brand uh JSON profile for my specific script writing style. Right? I want you to read the transcripts of my following YouTube videos and extract the JSON profile um for my brand voice specific words that I use, my tone, style, um way of writing, sentence, length, um storytelling style.

 I just want to give it a couple parameters. Um, I want to have this as a document so that I can give you a topic and I can write a script in my style and then you can just give it right clots on at four is the model that I'm using and let's see what it gives us. So here you can see it's dropped an artifact, right? Brand, voice, personality, educational, mentor, casual, authority, confidence, helpful, direct, conversational.

 Wait, what? But here's the thing. This is huge, gamechanging. So really, there's just like signature phrases that they'll be able to extract that that I think is is really good. I don't think you can really do this with Chbt super well. Um, but yeah, transitions here, emphasis words, credibility builders, sentence structures.

 So it extracts all of this, right? So here I just want to copy this like, hey, uh, use this JSON profile to write me a script on how to make a killer YouTube video, right? And, uh, I'm kind of just prompting this. This isn't actually how you write a full script, but here you can see that it's able to, you know, use his brand voice and be able to write the script based on that, right? And here you have the hook, right? You spend weeks planning your video. You film for hours.

 You edit until your eyes bleed. You hit upload. 47 views, three likes, and the only comment is mouth. So, like this is like pretty on brand. And um you can use this for if you're writing for your own channel. You can use this for if you're writing for another client's channel. Just train Claude on the brand voice, extract the JSON profile, and you'll be able to write scripts in their voice just like this.

 Right? Of course, right? You want to give it the specific payoffs in order to actually write it. You don't want to oneshot it. You want it to, you know, give you a couple hook variations. You want to give it a couple uh body body writing variations, couple body writing variations. Now, I have another video where I use AI to write a script.

So, you can click it over here. I'm going to link it over here or link it in the description, too. But, um yeah, this is like the number one use case that I have it do. It's that it's used to extract the brand voice. Okay, let's talk about another use case. The other use case I use other than just extracting the brand voice um is to edit the script.

 There are certain things that you'll really miss out when you're editing the script and uh you want to just use AI to be able to pinpoint certain things that you're not able to see. And once again, when we're editing the script, right, there's a couple principles that I went over previously. you can pretty much take the transcript of me talking about how to edit a video, uh, feed it to AI as kind of like the guidelines, the baseline guidelines on, um, what to look out for when you're writing, uh, when when you're editing a video. That's also one of the things that that you can do, right? You can take slides, you can take PDFs, you can take sort of guides as training information for it, and then it'll be able to edit a script for it. So, let's just do it right now. So, let's go over here. We have the editing slides and here we can just I'm just going to download it as a PDF and then here I'm going to upload the PDF onto Claude once I have it downloaded. So here I'm just going to upload the editing slides and here right we have the script how to escape the rat race without quitting your 9 to5 that we previously wrote. So

let's see how it gives me comments and how it edits um the first part. So I'm just going to copy this whole thing and then you want to also tell it what you fed it. So, uh, you are a YouTube script writer with millions of views under your belt and you're a proficient copywriter. So, here I'm giving it a role.

 I gave you a PDF on how to edit a script. Uh, I want your help to critique my script and edit it for me. I gave you a script that I've written on how to escape the rat race without quitting your 9 to5. The first point that I wrote is the one I want you to critique uh not uh the hook.

 Can you give me certain weaknesses and modifications that you'd make to the first point? And you can see here the way that I prompted I try to be as specific as possible as to what certain requirements that I wanted to have. Right? So you can see over here here look at your first point about reframing your 95. You can see the M comments solid was several areas that were tightened.

 So weak transition right contradicting message right overused example repetitive content unclear structure weak call to action. So there we go. So, it gives a suggested rewrite here, your current script. The truth is, most people have their 9 to5 completely backwards. They see it as a prison when it should be their launching pad. Here's what I mean.

Right now, you're probably going to work, doing your task, collecting a paycheck, and going home. You're trading time for money with no long-term plan. But what if I told you your job could be your secret weapon for escaping the rat race? There only two things that matter. Building your bank account and building your skill set.

 Everything else is noise. If your job teaches you valuable skills like digital marketing, sales, project management, milk it for everything it's worth. Stay late, ask questions, volunteer for projects, you're getting paid to learn skills that could make you millions. If your job doesn't teach you anything valuable, then it becomes your cash flow machine.

Will you build skills outside of work, use every lunch break, every commute, every evening to develop high income abilities. The only difference between someone stuck in the rat race and someone who escapes it. Skills. That's it. Your 9 to5 isn't your enemy. It's your stepping stone.

 The question is are you using it to climb up or standing still? So you can see here even it's able to identify mistakes that I'm not able to identify. Right? But the base copy is something that I have to write and that way it'll give it a baseline for it to refine. And uh obviously this I'm trying to just use like single training data on uh how to edit and what to edit for. Uh but it's pretty good.

It's already substantially better. You can see the way that it edits, it just cuts a lot of words and yeah, this is arguably a lot better. Is this say a perfect edit? No, not by any means. Is it a good stepping stone? I would say it's a pretty good stepping stone. I must emphasize I think the base of your copy needs to be written by you or at the very least very heavily edited by you.

 You don't just want to like give it to an AI to write that's really like fully outsourcing your brain. You still need to think. As much as people don't like doing it, you still do need to do a little bit of thinking. Um, AI is really there to supplement it. And really the thinking here that I did is like, hey, right, I'm gonna feed it this, I'm gonna feed it, I'm gonna feed it this, and here I'm going to prompt it.

 And that's pretty much the steps that I used um in order to use AI to edit a script. And um, yeah, if you want this uh editing slides PDF, I'm going to add it in the workbook, too, so that you can download it and you can, you know, test out this exact workflow. Um there's going to be SOP on how to actually execute this inside the workbook.

 So you can get it all there. So instead of just using Claude and I know I kind of mentioned that oh you wouldn't really use Claude or Chad GBT to fully write scripts, you use something like subscriber and subscriber.ai is built by my good friend Gil and it's specially used for writing YouTube scripts.

 So, it says, "Create viral YouTube scripts in minutes and become niche famous with this AI tool." Um, and um, I'll kind of go over how I use it and how I think about using it and the different ways that you can use it for all of these different types of channels. And we're going to recreate kind of the imongi script that I wrote a portion of it from scratch.

 And like we'll kind of see if we can use AI to write it. So, this tool just for like some kind of transparency, right? this tool is somewhere in the ballpark $200 per year. And so if you kind of do the math backwards, it'll be about like $20 a month or like $25 a month, something like that.

 Um, which is uh which is a pretty fair price. It's pro it's cheaper than CHBT. And this is specifically used for writing YouTube scripts. So, it's trained on the data and the scripts of literally thousands, I think maybe like 2,000 to 5,000 plus winning YouTube scripts and kind of understands the structures and it's trained on all of my my own stuff cuz I'm good friends of Gil and I started my YouTube channel, this YouTube channel at around the same time as Gil started this software.

 So, let's go into the tool and see how you can kind of use it. When you get the tool, you'll immediately go to a page like this and there's a bunch of tools, right? There's breakdown where you can analyze successful videos. If you go here, if you paste any YouTube video, you'll be able to fully break it down.

So, let's maybe break down a famous YouTube video, right? Let's say you want to break down um this script from me. Say you really liked this um this video and you want to break it down. So, like let's just copy the link and then you'll be able to go into subscriber and then it'll be able to analyze.

 So, we'll just let it load for a little bit and then we'll see what it comes up with. So, you can see here right 20,000 views, 2.4x 4x average, the different topics, the tone, the narrative techniques, right? It gives you about this video, the potential audience, the title analysis, um the outline, and then it's analyzing the opening hook and the curiosity gaps will give it a little bit of time, right? It says it's a shocking statement, right? It'll give you literally a breakdown of the winning video that you want to analyze. So that way, you know, as YouTubers, you, you know, look at all of these outliers and you see what's working and you need to break it down and you watch it bit by bit by bit. This uses AI to really break it down. And because it understands the YouTube context and it understands, hey, I have to look out for a really strong hook and hey, I have to look out for really strong curiosity gaps. That's when you can kind of use something like this to analyze the videos and it, you know, gives you a lot more context, right? Say the knowledge gap, right? First step is by far the most important yet also the most overlooked. Right? This is the open loop. And this statement sets up a knowledge gap by suggesting that most people miss the

most crucial step. Paradox reveal and mystery challenge reveal and call to action. Obviously, you'd only be breaking down videos that have performed well, right? If a video hasn't performed well and isn't a strong outlier in a certain channel, there's no reason to even break it out.

 So something like this, it's really easy to learn YouTube a lot faster and learn YouTube script writing a lot faster when you can break down the script of these winning faceless or educational videos. And another thing that I use subscriber for, right, you can use it to write descriptions, right? So um you can add video details, add your channel, and you can immediately generate descriptions.

It needs a little bit of editing. You know, if you paste your script here, it'll be able to generate you a pretty good description. And then you can use it to write hooks, keywords, generate different titles, right? Use it to create tags, right? So you don't have to use any any what of a tool.

 You can use it use tags, the thumbnails, transcripts, or you can generate the transcripts. You don't have to use like come or anything. These are in the tool section. But what I really want to show you guys is how you can use it to write scripts. So here you can go to channels, right? And then you can say add your first channel.

 And then say you want to write for Iangi. Say you have a client or you can use it for yourself. Immediately once you type in, you can see it's icon here. You'll immediately get aspiring young entrepreneur, right? You can get the demographics, right? 16 to 24, male, the income range, education. All of it's like pretty accurate, right? Motivational videos, business podcast, self-help blogs, entrepreneurial forums, YouTube vlogs, business advice channels, personal finance channels, and like the key questions you can ask. These key questions will help you come up with video ideas will help you come up with, you know, what exactly that you want to talk about within these videos. And here you can see all the different tabs, right? This is the audience. So this is the first thing that you get. You can understand your audience a little bit better. And that way it will help you write the scripts a little bit better or it helps the AI understand how to write the scripts. So let's go to voice here. Here you can immediately see the voice, right? So you can use it to generate a voice, right? And here we can use it to generate the preview, right? you a successful young I'm sure I'm speaking directly d or making acknowledging the hype and misinformation online.

Emphasize that achieving this isn't easy but is achievable. Frame your advice around three key components. Find the right vehicle. Right? So this is you know kind of like a sample prompt that you can give it and you can see whether the voice is accurate or not. So look ladies and gentlemen that's something that Gaji starts his video with usually right? I know a lot of you guys are seeing these crazy videos online about making $10,000 a month and thinking it's some kind of magic trick. Let me tell you the truth right now. It's not easy, but it is absolutely achievable if you approach it the right way. I hit my first 10K month when I was 22. But here's the thing that nobody talks about. It took me three years of grinding. And honestly, I got lucky with timing on a few things. Your journey is go going to be different than mine. And that's completely okay. You know, like first draft, this voice isn't bad, right? And that's also because Gaji has like all of these videos out there and we can have a good idea of his voice. And if you know you put in your own channel and the preview isn't accurate, what you can do is you can go here and you can edit the voice, right? You can give it feedback. You can paste samples of writing that you have. Maybe you have

emails that you've written. Maybe you have, you know, Instagram res that you scripted. You can just put it all here and you can give it feedback and it can refine, refine, refine, refine. But with someone like Gaji, he has so many videos out there already that's, you know, so in his voice like it I think it picks it up pretty well.

 And if you want to edit it, you can. But and this is simple mode and there's advanced mode, right? And you can kind of like edit all of these on your own. So it's actually very customizable and you can prompt it accordingly. Really the problem with using most AI script writers out there is that there aren't really guardrails and it's difficult to teach it.

 You know, kind of like what the different guardrails are. But here you can see that here you can give it the style, the type, the narrative perspective, the vocabulary level, the style of the tone. And if you combine like subscriber with what we did with Claude in order to get the brand voice, right? It's the exact same thing, right? Oh, what is the sentence structure that you want? Okay, short sentence length distribution, short sentences and meeting sentences, long sentences, right? Paragraph structure, language complexity, writing characteristics, narrative structure, right? Common phrases, right? and you can add even more common phrases so it knows exactly what kind of words um to say. Right? So that's the channel voice and really the most important part about writing a scriptive AI is answering the channel voice question and being able to identify that at a very high level and being very granular and very specific with that. So that's with the voice and then you can go into the research right sources can be added right. So as you write the script and be prompted later, you'll be able to see different sections where you're able to add research. And

here the last bar here is the settings, right? You can change the audience, you can change the voice setting, language, the target length of video, the format. Uh you can choose which AI model you like to write with. Right? Deep Seek is pretty good nowadays. Uh Gemini is getting a little bit better.

 Claude is getting a little bit better. So really when you get this subscription you're able to write with all of these different models. So it's actually you actually like save a ton of money um instead of just buying you know uh uh chat premium and claude premium um you all you have to do is just like get subscriber and you'll get access to all of these different models.

 Let's get into actually writing a script. So uh over here when you click script you can either get the content ideas or you can go create script. So let's just say we go create script and we already have a video topic that we want to talk about which is here right? So it's how to escape the rat race without quitting your 9 to5.

 So if we were to just you know control arr c and I want to paste all of this into subscriber I would just paste it all here. Okay so format we can just pick the format. It is more of an educational video. Target length say we're going for something that's like 2500 words along around the 15-inute length.

 And the title of the video is how to escape the rat race without quitting your 9 to5, right? And you can literally just add in whatever topic that you want. Audience language, right? Script number one. You can see your credits available. And bang, you go and create scripts. Okay. So, you go here. Everything looks good. Then I can press the start research button. Right. Right.

Use the menu on left to navigate. Start with research. Progress through each step in order. Feel free to revisit and refine previous steps. There you go. So, you can go to research. So, you can see on the left bar all of the different stages. So this tool, one of the things that I like about it is that it literally takes you through each step of writing a script like an actual YouTube script writer, right? Not something that you press one button and you like pray that the output is actually good.

 Here you go through research, you go through the frame, you go through the title, you help create a thumbnail, right? You hook payoffs, you draft it, and you edit it, and then you export it. So let's just press research, and then we'll see what happens. So if there's any other like a research sources that we want to add, we can add any like research sources.

 So one of the things that you can do is you can just add YouTube videos. So we can see here if we go back here to how to escape the rat race, we would just go into I felt trapped on a we would just go into this and then I can immediately add my research sources and it'll just transcribe it manually. So I'm just going to paste a bunch of these YouTube videos here about this as a tax strategist.

 And then if you clicked on this video without getting offended here, I'm just going to add the tree YouTube videos just for the sake of speed. But you can literally add anything, right? If you have PDFs and documents that you want to add, you can, right? If you want to search the web, you can.

 If you want to add certain links that you can, you can literally do anything. And then once you're done with your research, right? And you know this is where you accumulate all all of the links. You can just go to frame and then it will start generating uh frame ideas. So basically the way that you want to think about the frame is the way that you frame the topic right is kind of like you know similar to the video idea will kind of depend will determine the performance of the video.

 So the frame is you know similar to the video idea similar to the title. Um but let's see what subscriber comes out with right. So you can see here right uh the different types of frame right problem solution transformation right case study or example driven instruction principle based learning with personal anecdote right so you can see here it helps come up with the angle which is like the video idea so and we get to pick which is the best and if these three are good you can ask it to generate even more so you can see here right this frame establishes the common rarities problem immediately challenges the conventional solution understood regarding their frustration with the 9 to5 they will gain a new perspective on their current employment viewing it as an opportunity rather than a crap. They understand the importance of intentionality and skill acquisition within their 9 to5. Moving from a mindset of passive waiting to active strategic planning. This leads to a sense of empowerment and clear path forward. Realizing that financial freedom is achievable without high-risisk moves. So this is this is probably the best but let's just read these. This frame uses the example of Jeff Bezos to illustrate how the 9 to5 can be leveraged as a strategic stepping stone. Right? Audience will learn identify valuable transfer skills that

can be acquired through their current employment or independent study. They understand the why behind staying in night in a 9 to5 temporarily and how this aligns with long-term entrepreneurial goals. This frame aims to transform their perception of time spent from wasted to invested. This is actually also pretty good.

 But let's see. This frame introduces the first key principle for escaping the rat race, recognizing one's independent. It uses a personal anecdote about feeling controlled in the past job. So, this one isn't really in line of Gaji story. So, it's either one of the two, right? So, I like let's say we want to pick one.

 I I think one or two both are pretty good, but let's just see what it comes up with. So, let's just pick one. And then we already have the title. So, I I don't need the title. If you need more options, you can click here. And then it'll immediately start generating titles.

 And not every title that it generates will be the best in the world. That's kind of up to you and your perception and your understanding of YouTube to, you know, kind of pick one here. Right. Four rules to beat the rat race. No quitting required. Right? 9 to5. Slavery is a myth. Here's proof. Your job is not your prison.

 Some of these are like pretty good. And here you can see the different variations. Uh for the sake of this, we've already picked the first one. So let's just run with it and let's see the next step. And the next step will be the thumbnail, right? So you can see here, you just wait and it'll start generating you thumbnail ideas.

 If you don't need a thumbnail, right, you're not a thumbnail designer, you're just a script writer, you can just go on to the next one. But like let's just see what uh thumbnails it helps create. So here you can see right a young man wearing office attire stands on a treadmill reaching for the golden exidor marked freedom or city skyline looms blending office and dream life.

Right. So, some of these can be pretty good, right? Some of these are more for the faceless side. Uh, I'm personally not a huge huge huge thumbnail expert, so I I won't really be able to say, but you know, maybe something like this, right? A split screen. Left side shows a bold young man at his desk with chains on his wrist.

 Right side shows the same man energized and free with a briefcase full of cash still in office clothes. Um, you know, kind kind of depends, right? Uh, and and you know, it kind of depends how you bring this to life. I personally don't use this tool as much for like the thumbnail ideation. I use it more for the script because I'm a script writer.

 So let's just see what kind of hooks it generates. So it literally follows the exact same step you know I personally use to write these scripts is you go in the exact order right you do the research first right and you give it links you give it transcripts and then you go and write the hook right now it's writing the hook and then once you write the hook you start selecting payoffs so you outline the video first and then you pick whatever payoff that you want and then you go and write those payoffs and then only once you get a first draft of everything then you start editing it right it it goes through exact same steps and we'll see what kind of hook ideas that we generate from this. There you go. So immediately you get a bunch of different hooks and you know it's nice to have a bunch of different hooks because you can immediately pick which one you think is the best, right? So let's just read a couple of these. What if I told you there's a way to escape the rat race without quitting your 9 to5? Qu most people think the only way is taking huge risks, but it's exactly why they stay stuck. I built multiple sevenfigure businesses while working a copper job. And today I'll show you how to use your 9 to5 as a launch pad

instead of a prison. The game changer. Four principles that completely reshape how you view your job. Number three will shock you. It's what Jeff Bezos did before starting Amazon from his garage. Like the first the first half I think is really good. And you don't necessarily have to use the whole thing, right? You can edit it based on like your own knowledge. So let's see.

 Here's the brutal race. Here's the brutal truth about leaving the rat race. Quitting your job is actually the worst first move. The wealthy don't take unnecessary risks. They leverage what they have. Your 9 to5 could be funding your future business right now. If you know these four principles, principle number two transformed how I used my free time and triple my income in 6 months.

 Stay to the end and I'll show you exactly how to implement it starting tonight. Let's see this one. 3 years ago, I was stuck in a sore crushing corporate job watching the clock tick slower than my bank account grew. Then I discovered you don't need to quit to escape. You just need to change your strategy.

 This realization helped me build my first million-dollar business while still employed. If you're watching this frustrated and your 9 to5, lean in close. I'm about to reveal how you can start your escape today without taking massive risk or sacrificing your paycheck. All right. So, say something like this is good. All right.

 Obviously, the story will need a little bit of amendments. Let's just run with this. Okay. And then we'll see what payoffs generates. So, now it's outlining the script for us where payoff one, payoff two, payoff three, payoff four. And we can just pick which ones that we like. There you go.

 So here we have the payoffs, right? What surprising truth about your 9 to5 could completely change how you view your current situation? How did Jeff Bezos not so important? What's the biggest mistake people make when trying to escape the rat race that keeps them trapped forever? So I think mistakes could work.

 Why do most people quit a job without a plan end up worse than before? Like let's talk about that for sure. What mindset ship separates successful entrepreneurs from being stuck in the rat race? Yeah, let's talk about that. How can you turn your boring 9 to5 into a skill building machine? 100%.

 What's one thing that differentiates people in the rat race from millionaire entrepreneurs? Maybe. Why would Elon Musk have a million dollars within a week even if he went bankrupt tomorrow? What are the four four core principles that can help you achieve financial freedom? So, there you go.

 Let's say we don't want to pick too many payoffs, but I think these five are pretty strong, right? Obviously, if you spend a little more time like reading through all these payoffs, you can pick better ones. But, let's just say I'm happy with these five. I can immediately go to draft and I will immediately generate outline and a draft.

 Right? So, now we'll create your script outline. You can choose to generate just the outline of both the outline and the full drive simultaneously. Generating just the outline enables you to view and refine the structure before moving on to write your content. So here you can just generate outline.

 Say you just want to generate outline. You don't have to write the full draft first. Give it some time and will generate the outline from there. So bam, the outline is generated and you can immediately see right you have the introduction from the payoffs, right? You have to number two the trap that most people people fall into, right? And you can see the outline, right? Here's what most people don't realize, right? And here it follows the exact same structure, right? Setup, tension, example, develop point, insight, twist, build, anticipation, resolution, transition, right? So you have your setup and then you have your payoff, right? Everything else is pretty much the payoff. And here, right, your job is your business school, right? Jeff Bezos didn't walk out of his office one day, right? Many success entrepreneurs build skills or employed, right? Study shows skills account for 85% of financial success. And bang, you go. Okay, next. Millionaire time strategy. Here's how most wealthy people treat time differently than the poor. Most people waste evenings and weekends recovering from work. Studies show working professionals waste 15 plus hours workly. So here you can save time. Okay. Next. Escaping the employee mindset. Why most people stay trapped even with skills and time. Right? Skills

and time alone won't make you financially free. The real barrier is seeing is how you see yourself and your options. Right? You have example and bang the 90-day escape plan and then what freedom actually looks like. Right? It's about becoming free, right? How my first business made money but kept me working 80 hours. Autonomy matters more.

So like let's say eh I'm not such a big fan of this, right? So I can just delete this section. Doesn't look super compelling. But then let's just say like this is good and this is something that I want to run with. Um then we can just go and immediately generate draft, right? We can start generating the draft for each of these.

 So and bang here you can see here. Yep. Here's what most people don't realize about escaping the rat race. Quitting your job isn't actually the answer, and I feel like the obvious solution when you're stuck in a job you hate, but it often just leads you into a different kind of trap. Most personal development gurus will tell you to quit your 9 to5 immediately to chase your dreams.

 But what they don't mention is that 90% of new businesses fail within the first year according to the data from blah blah blah. That means nine out of 10 people who follow that advice end up worse off than when they started. I saw this happen to my friend Ryan, right? He watched a few motivational videos, blah blah blah. Here's the problem with quitting too soon. Desperation changes how you think.

When your bank account is draining and bills are due, you stop making rational long-term decisions. You take bad clients, chase quick money instead of building real value and often end up right back you started. Your current 9to5 could be your biggest advantage if you use it strategically. It gives you steady income while you build skills, make connections, and test business ideas with minimal risk.

 The first principle is seeing your job as a tool rather than a trap. That mental shift changes everything because now you're working for your future self and not your boss. You can see here just reading it, it's pretty compelling, right? It's it's pretty close to to what God has. Not to say that it's perfect, right? But it's actually pretty good.

 And if you just go to each of these, right, you generate a draft of each of these and you can see here it's actually pretty good, right? You have you have the outline that it gives you. And if you really like the outline, you can just run of it. If you're not happy with the outline, right, you can ask it to regenerate it or you can edit the outline.

 And that way it really helps you kind of like systematically see, okay, how do you write each point? How do you write each point? How do you write each point? How do you write each point? Okay, so now that we've generated like one or two sections, if you think, okay, all of these are good, all of these setups are good, you can go here to actions, and you can immediately generate the full drop.

 So you press one button and it will write the full script based on the outline that you read and you approved. And now it's just going to generate the full thing. So, we'll give it a little bit of time to see what it comes up with. And bang, there you go. Kind of see like here you have a full script and you have like full for like each section.

 And if you want, you can go here and you can edit it. Or here, if you press the next button to edit here, you can get feedback on your script. So, you can get AI to write the full script. And then, uh, there's another section that is kind of just trained on editing the script. So, here, right, your draft is done.

 Now, let's make it better by reviewing and editing it. You can only do this once, so make sure you're satisfied with the overall structure and content of your draft before moving forward. So, here, let's just see what kind of feedback it generates, right? And here you can see suggestions, right? This draft is a strong relatable hook, clear problem solution framing, but it overstates and mis misattribute statistics that aren't directly supported by the provided research and repeats ideas rather than deepening them. It can be tightened by removing unspoiled figures, chopping transitions between principles to sustain viewer curiosity. Focusing each section on a single core takeaway validated by the background material and cutting redundant phrasing will improve ph pacing and retention while preserving the conversational toll that resonates with ambitious 16 to 24 year olds. You can see here it has suggestions, right? Factual check, right? Built my million-dollar business while still employed, right? Engagement, right? To heighten curiosity hinted one surprising tactic you'll review later. For example, add and the trick that made it all the difference wasn't what you expected before rolling into the promise of revealing your strategy and then pacing. Right? Second sentence is a bit long. So I suggest splitting all of it. So you

can see here there's original versus rewritten. So the rewritten part is 3 years ago I was stuck in a soul crushing corporate job watching the clock take slower than my bank account grew. Then I realized you don't have to quit to escape the 9 to5 to escape the rat race. You just need to change your strategy.

In my case, that shift helped me build my first multi- a million-dollar business while I was still employed. And the trick that made all the difference wasn't what you expected. If you're frustrated at your 9 to5, listen closely. So, this is this is closer to what Gajji says, right? Gaji always says, listen closely.

 I'm about to show you how you can start your escape today without taking massive risks or giving up your paycheck. But first, let's clear clear up one of the biggest misconceptions that keeps people trapped. It's like a pretty good pretty good rewritten hook, right? And you can see here it rewrites like entire sections, right? And you can just read it and be like, hey, right, do I accept it? Say I accept it, then this would be good, right? You can see the rewrite.

 If you accept it, it's good. See the rewrite, you can accept it, it's good. So this is a really great way for you to even if you're a beginner script writer number one, to see how professional script writers think, right? If you don't get have access to me, you can use use a tool like this and it will be able to tell you, hey, what does bad look like and what does good look like? Very rarely does an AI tell you what bad looks like and what good looks like.

 But with subscriber, it tells you, hey, actually the initial draft that we wrote isn't that great based on all of these criteria that we have for um for editing scripts and it gives you corrections based on that. Usually what AI tools do like for example JGBT, it'll give you an output.

 If you don't know that it's bad, you won't tell it that it's bad, right? But this AI tool literally, hey, actually the initial draft that we gave you is bad. Um, here this is something that's a little bit better and that you can use, right? And it literally does it for the entire script, right? Where else do you find something that is able to give you suggestions for the entire script, give you specific line by line rewrites based on its understanding of what good YouTube scripts look like.

That just never happens, right? So, you can see here, say you just accept everything and you read all of this just for the sake of the video. We'll just accept everything and bang. Then, let's say this whole script is good. You can immediately press export and you can export it, right? You can see the word count, see the reading grade, you can see how long it takes for you to speak.

You can see the re readability and bang, right? You can you can copy the script. You can download the script, right? You can get the research report. You can get the thumbnail. You can hear go to docs.ne. And you can paste the whole script here. And here you have a fully written script all done in like literally less than 10 minutes.

 And here you can you know have the title you can generate a description right with what I talked about. So you can generate description can start generating tags and here it'll immediately make it so that it's easy for you to upload right. So here informative so you can pick whatever description that you want and then here it'll help you generate tags and you can just copy the tags and you can paste it inside um of your video.

 So it makes creating the video scripting the video way easier. And now descript is easy to record and once the video is edited description tags is all done for you. So this tool is made for number one AI YouTube script writing which I think is really great use case and it's something that I personally use quite a lot uh for myself and for clients and it makes you know creating this content a lot easier especially the editor.

 The editor is um one of the better features out there that I've seen within AI tools. And um I personally like use this to like write descriptions and and write tags, right? Descriptions isn't necessarily the most important thing within your YouTube video. It's kind of an annoying thing to write.

 Um and that's why you can kind of use this, right? It's trained on like how to write descriptions um accurately. And um if you have the script and then you have the tags, it makes it a lot easier to like go out there and create the video, right? So this is this is um this is a tool that I like to use.

 It's called subscriber.ai. Um, once again, right, it's $1.99, right? There's a bunch of other features, right? You can get a 100 scripts per year, right? Two channels, one additional user. The viral topic finder. So, if you need to find viral topics, you're not sure of content ideas.

 Uh, there was a content idea button which allowed you to find, okay, like what's working right now, there's kind of an analysis of uh of YouTube as a whole, and it's able to give you recommendations based on that. And then there's a remix any viral video feature. Uh that means you can you know paste a YouTube video um into subscriber and then if it's a format that you like it's able to remix it in your voice for your specific channel.

 So that way you can take something that's working and then remix it for your niche. So there's also that function right there's the research tools uh as you saw right you can literally paste in YouTube videos instead of like transcribing it putting the chat JVT oh the chat is too full chat is too long and then you have to redo it. Press one button and it's done.

uh and you get pri priority support and also there's like a 30-day money back guarantee. Um so if the tool isn't something that you like for whatever reason and you don't get value out of it. Um yeah, it's it's something it's something that you can go ahead and um and play with.

 This is uh this is subscriber AI. I I think I think it's pretty good. I have a lot of friends who who use it and um I personally use it and I think it's one of the better uh AI YouTube script writing tools out there specifically for writing YouTube scripts. If you really want to write better scripts, if you need help uh you know going through the entire process, creating idea, title, framing, uh the actual payoffs of the video, actually writing the script, actually editing the script, uh I think this tool is probably the best tool out there to do that. So Gail, the founder, and I are good friends, and you know, he's kind of put together a special deal for Viral Bangers and uh the Viral Bangers audience, my audience, and the subscriber tool and it will be at $1.99. Um, I have no idea how long this will be up for. Yeah, it's um it's it's a pretty good tool. I would highly recommend using it.
