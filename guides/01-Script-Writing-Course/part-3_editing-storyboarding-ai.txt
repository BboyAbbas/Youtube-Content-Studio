# YouTube Script Writing Course - Part 3: Editing, Storyboarding & AI Tools

## Script Editing

Now that you guys are here, I just want to say thank you for staying all the way to this point and really learning the skill of YouTube script writing because I do believe it's one of probably the most important skills to have in content creation today.

### Why Editing is Important

When you master editing, everything changes:
- You cut your writing time in half
- Less revisions and production time wasted  
- You make your scripts more high quality

Your first draft is for dumping ideas. Editing shapes those ideas into a coherent and polished narrative. A well-edited script makes your audience stay engaged and makes them take action.

### The POWER Method for Editing

**P - Pause**
After finishing your first draft, take a break. This incubation period allows you to return to your script with fresh eyes. Even after a short break, like an hour, it can help you spot things you've missed.

This works because it's easier to identify weak spots when you're not emotionally attached to the writing. When you distance yourself, you're not emotionally attached to the script and can see it from a third person lens.

**O - Out Loud Test**
Reading a script aloud is one of the easiest ways to catch awkward phrasing or unnatural flow. Pretend you're delivering the script to an audience, and if something doesn't sound right, change it.

This helps you identify:
- Sentences that are too long or overly complicated
- Unnatural transitions
- Words that don't flow well together

Example of chunky writing: "Our company, which has been in the business of providing top quality, innovative solutions to clients for over 15 years, is uniquely positioned to leverage its extensive expertise."

Revised: "For over 15 years, our company has delivered innovative solutions."

**W - Work with Tools**
Use editing tools like Grammarly or Claude to clean up grammar and spelling mistakes. These tools catch small errors that distract from your message and can suggest clearer phrasing for complex ideas.

I personally recommend Hemingway Editor - it grades your writing according to reading level. You want to keep it to fifth to seventh grade reading level.

**E - Evaluate the Flow**
Your script should flow logically from one point to the next. Each sentence should guide the audience seamlessly to the next idea.

Check for flow by asking:
- Does each point connect naturally to the next?
- Are transitions smooth?
- Is your argument building meaningfully towards something?

Common flow problems include using too many filler words like "next," "let's dive into this," or "here's a harsh truth." These can be cut if they don't contribute to the main narrative.

**R - Record Yourself Check**
Record yourself reading the script using Loom or your camera. Watch your delivery and see issues you didn't catch while writing.

Hearing the script aloud shows whether it sounds natural. Watching a performance highlights parts that drag or feel disconnected.

### Editing Different Sections

**Editing Hooks:**
- Does the first line validate the title and thumbnail?
- Have you set clear expectations for what the video will deliver?
- Is there a curiosity gap that makes viewers want to keep watching?

**Editing the Body:**
- Are you building towards the next step?
- Have you explained why your audience should care?
- Did you include actionable tips or clear examples?
- Are the transitions smooth?

**Editing Call to Actions:**
- Do you have a single clear call to action?
- Do you link the CTA to the video's content?
- Have you promised a transformation or benefit for clicking?

### Common Editing Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Overthinking the first draft** - Write quickly, then focus on refining
2. **Using jargon** - Edit out complex terminology
3. **Skipping the hook** - Don't start with irrelevant details
4. **Rushing the editing process** - Don't skip steps like checking flow
5. **Ignoring flow** - Don't jump between unrelated points without transitions

### Final Editing Tips

- **Cut the fluff** - If a word or sentence doesn't add value, cut it
- **Focus on the audience** - Tailor your script to their needs and understanding level
- **Simplify** - Your goal is to be clear, not complex

## Storyboarding

Storyboarding in YouTube script writing is when you add notes in your script for the editor. It's basically a guide to help the editor visualize your video.

Whether you're writing scripts for yourself or a client, it's important to storyboard so the editor knows what clips to put in, what visuals to add, and how you envision the final video.

### What Good Storyboarding Includes

- **Notes about editing and effects** - "Zoom in on the subject during this line"
- **Links to examples or references** - Specific clips with timestamps
- **Ideas for pacing** - "Play investigative sounding music here"

This improves your videos by:
- Keeping things clear - everyone knows what to do
- Saving time - editors don't have to guess
- Making videos engaging - proper visual storytelling
- Helping you scale - you focus on ideas while editors handle execution

### The VRCT Framework

**V - Visuals**: Add fade to black after this line, use slow motion shot here
**R - References**: Any links to videos or images  
**C - Clips**: Specific video clips you want to use
**T - Time codes**: Timestamps to guide when and where to add effects

You want to spend time sourcing specific clips and adding time codes so your editor can save time when editing.

### Common Storyboarding Mistakes

**Too Many Details**: Overwhelming the editor with unnecessary information. Keep notes concise and only include what's essential.

**No Context**: Vague notes like "make the edit better" don't help. Use the VRCT framework to be specific.

**Copyright Problems**: Using unlicensed clips or music can get your video demonetized. Use copyright-free resources and double-check usage rights.

**Ignoring Your Editor**: If you try to control everything, you miss out on valuable expertise. Give editors creative freedom within your guidelines.

### Storyboarding Best Practices

- Keep notes concise but specific
- Include timestamps for all clips
- Use copyright-free materials
- Collaborate with your editor rather than micromanaging
- Focus on VRCT: Visuals, References, Clips, Time codes

Alternative approaches:
- Record a Loom video explaining your vision
- Draw simple sketches of key visual moments
- Have a conversation with your editor about the overall style

## AI for Script Writing

Finally, we can talk about AI. The reason I decided to put this AI section at the very end is because AI isn't super important when you are trying to write a YouTube script.

If you want to use AI efficiently, you need to answer two questions:
1. **What does a good script look like?** - So when AI gives you output, you can assess if it's good or bad
2. **What questions should you ask it?** - There's never going to be a world where you can one-shot prompt a full YouTube script

### AI Tools I Use

**Perplexity** - Great for research, can browse the web and do deep research. Especially useful when writing for new niches you're not familiar with.

**Claude** - Best for writing and understanding brand voice. As of May 2025, Claude is probably the best model for writing.

I don't use AI to fully write scripts. Instead, I write in chunks and use AI strategically for specific tasks.

### Use Case #1: Brand Voice Extraction

You can train Claude on your brand voice by:
1. Feeding it transcripts of 3-5 of your best videos
2. Asking it to extract a JSON profile of your writing style
3. Using that profile to write new content in your voice

Example prompt:
"I want you to extract a JSON profile for my specific script writing style. Read these transcripts and extract my brand voice, specific words I use, tone, style, sentence length, storytelling style."

Claude will create a detailed profile including:
- Personality traits
- Common phrases  
- Sentence structures
- Transition styles
- Emphasis words

You can then use this profile by saying: "Use this JSON profile to write me a script on [topic]"

### Use Case #2: Script Editing

You can use AI to help edit your scripts by:
1. Uploading your editing guidelines (like the POWER method)
2. Giving it your script to critique
3. Asking for specific weaknesses and modifications

Example prompt:
"You are a YouTube script writer. I gave you a PDF on how to edit scripts. I want your help to critique my script. Can you give me weaknesses and modifications for the first point?"

AI can identify issues you might miss:
- Weak transitions
- Contradicting messages  
- Unclear structure
- Repetitive content
- Poor flow

### Subscriber.ai - Specialized Tool

This tool is built specifically for YouTube script writing and is trained on thousands of winning scripts. It costs about $200/year.

Features include:
- **Breakdown**: Analyze successful videos to understand what works
- **Channel Setup**: Understand your audience demographics and interests
- **Voice Generation**: Create content in your specific style
- **Research Tools**: Add sources and references
- **Step-by-Step Process**: Guides you through research → frame → title → thumbnail → hook → payoffs → draft → edit

The tool follows the exact same process professional script writers use, taking you through each step systematically rather than trying to generate everything at once.

### Key AI Principles

1. **You need to understand what good looks like** - AI is only as good as your ability to evaluate its output
2. **Never one-shot prompt** - Break tasks into chunks and refine iteratively  
3. **Use AI to supplement, not replace thinking** - You still need to provide strategy and judgment
4. **Train on your specific style** - Generic AI output won't match your brand voice
5. **Focus on editing and refinement** - AI is better at improving existing content than creating from scratch

### AI Limitations

- Can't replace your strategic thinking
- Outputs generic content without proper training
- Doesn't understand context the way humans do
- Can't guarantee viral success
- Still requires human judgment and editing

The key is using AI as a powerful assistant while maintaining human creativity and strategic oversight.
