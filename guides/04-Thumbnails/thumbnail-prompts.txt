A shirtless, muscular man with a defined chest and visible claw marks on his face and torso stands in an intense, dynamic pose with his hands mid-gesture. Behind him is a large, centered artwork of a tiger's face staring directly ahead, adding a fierce, dramatic mood to the scene. The setting is indoors with dark shadows and faint posters or papers in the background. The word "LEE" appears subtly near the tiger image. The aesthetic is semi-realistic with muted colors and a cinematic tone. Minimalist white line drawing on pure black background. Hand-sketched aesthetic with wobbly, imperfect lines like chalk on blackboard. Use only white lines, no fill/shading. Basic shapes: circles for heads, dots for eyes, simple curves. Varying line thickness, sketchy continuous strokes. Play-like, playful quality. Dark grey background elements subtle and non-distracting.



Draw a low-angle view of a confident muscular stick figure man standing tall with a proud, relaxed posture. His head is tilted with a smirk, exuding self-assurance. The background should be a simple sky with light cloud doodles or abstract upward lines to emphasize the empowering angle. Use minimalist white chalk line art on a black background. Keep the stick figure style consistent with the other thumbnails—round head, bold smile or expressive eyes, and visible chest and arm definition



Minimalist chalk-drawn thumbnail scene. A mascular figure version of a man lies in bed on his side, holding a cigarette to his mouth with two fingers. His eyes look upward with a thoughtful, tired expression. The figure’s pose suggests deep reflection or emotional heaviness. Add subtle smoke drifting from the cigarette. Use bold text above the figure that says 'Late Night Thoughts' with the words 'Thoughts' inside a bright pink rectangle. Maintain the hand-drawn sketch aesthetic on a dark background, with imperfect, wobbly white lines and simple shapes



A muscular stick figure man with a confident expression is standing in front of a large bookshelf filled with books labeled in Japanese characters. He is holding an open book in both hands, reading with intense focus. The background shows rows of books fading into the distance. The figure has defined chest and shoulder lines and is drawn with rough white sketch lines on a pure black background. Add bold, simple text above the character that says “Learn Anything” — with “Learn” in white and “Anything” in a bold pink highlight box. Use sketchy, hand-drawn elements only, no shading or color fills. The composition should feel focused and motivating, like a productivity or learning-themed YouTube thumbnail.

Minimalist chalk-drawn thumbnail scene. A muscular stick figure man lies on his back with his head tilted sideways, holding a lit cigarette near his mouth with two fingers. His expression shows distant, introspective eyes with a calm but heavy look suggesting deep thought or quiet melancholy. Simple lines indicate a loose blanket or shirt partially covering his torso. Use rough white sketch lines on a pure black background with hand-drawn, wobbly, imperfect lines like chalk on blackboard. Keep the aesthetic simple - circle for head, dots for eyes, basic curves for body definition. Add subtle smoke drifting from the cigarette. Focus entirely on the character's face and hand gesture. Add bold text above the figure that says "Deep Thoughts" with the word "Thoughts" inside a bright pink rectangle. Maintain sketchy, continuous strokes with varying line thickness and no fill or shading.
