Create an image of a medieval admiral standing on the deck of a grand wooden warship. The character should wear an ornate admiral's coat with historical armor elements, a sword at their side, and a commanding presence. The ship should feature tall masts, sails, and medieval naval design, with crew members and ocean visible in the background. The scene should reflect authority, strategy, and readiness for battle.

Style: Cinematic digital painting with realistic lighting

Color Settings:
– Foreground elements and outlines must be pure white 
– Background elements should be dark grey, slightly subtly drawn so they do not stand out or distract from the main subject
– Overall background color must be pure black 

Aspect Ratio: 3:2

drawing style:
minimalist line drawing using only white lines on a solid black background. Use a rough, hand-sketched aesthetic with imperfect, slightly wobbly lines that look like they were drawn quickly with a digital brush or marker. The style should be extremely simple and child-like, similar to chalk on a blackboard or white crayon on black paper.
Key characteristics:

Use only white/light colored lines, no fill or shading
Keep all shapes basic: circles for heads, simple curved lines for smiles, dots for eyes
Make lines look hand-drawn and slightly uneven, not computer-perfect
Use minimal detail - suggest forms rather than fully render them
Draw with confident, continuous strokes that have a sketchy, loose quality
Keep the overall composition very simple, like a quick doodle or stick figure drawing
The lines should have varying thickness and opacity, as if drawn with a pressure-sensitive brush
Maintain a playful, innocent quality similar to children's drawings or quick concept sketches
