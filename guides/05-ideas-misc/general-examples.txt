They look like they just heard something strange or unexpected. Simple cartoon style

Defined chest and abs with simple line work. Clean minimalist style

Friendly cartoon brain character using a big eraser to remove 90% of swirling information around it, leaving only 10% of the brightest, most important details. The brain looks happy and focused. Simple, bright cartoon style.
