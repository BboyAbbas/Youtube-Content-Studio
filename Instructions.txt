Create a prompt for an AI image generator to illustrate a scene. I want scene demonstration to be simple, fun and very clear!
Follow same patterns as the attached examples.
Do not say "Same" and "or"
Be clear and visual.
Refer to the current script attached for context.

CHARACTER CONSISTENCY:
- Main character has NO description (just "cartoon person" or "standing cartoon person")
- Supporting characters (mom, mentor, soldier, etc.) must use exact descriptions from Character Reference Sheet
- Use the same character description every time that character appears

OBJECT CONSISTENCY:
- If an object appears in multiple scenes, use the EXACT same description each time
- Example: If a notepad is introduced as "white notepad with 'GOALS' written at the top in bold letters", use that exact description in ALL scenes featuring that notepad
- This applies to: notepads, phones, calendars, trophies, books, tools, and any recurring objects
- Create visual continuity so viewers recognize the same object across scenes

NO MEMORY RULE:
- The AI image generator has NO memory between scenes
- NEVER reference things vaguely like "the five steps" or "the thing from before"
- Every prompt must be FULLY SELF-CONTAINED with all necessary context
- If referencing steps, lists, or concepts from the script, explicitly state what they are
- Example BAD: "The five steps shown as blocks"
- Example GOOD: "Five blocks labeled '1. SHUT UP', '2. PICK ONE', '3. START UGLY', '4. SHOW UP', '5. UPGRADE'"

SERIES CONSISTENCY RULE:
- When consecutive sentences follow a similar pattern (e.g., "No phone", "No music", "No distractions"), ALL scenes in that series must use the SAME visual style/pattern
- Pick one visual approach and apply it consistently across the entire series
- Example: If "No phone" uses a prohibition circle with large X, then "No music" and "No distractions" must ALSO use prohibition circles with large X
- This applies to: lists, comparisons, repetitive statements, parallel structures
- Example patterns to keep consistent:
  - "Not X, Not Y, Not Z" → same rejection visual style
  - "Even when X, Even when Y" → same persistence visual style  
  - "Step 1, Step 2, Step 3" → same step introduction style
  - "They'll do X, Then they'll Y" → same prediction visual style

COLOR USAGE RULES:
- Use color ONLY when it carries semantic meaning or represents the object's natural color
- NEVER use color for decoration or emphasis alone

WHEN TO USE COLOR:
1. Semantic/Functional Meaning:
   - Green = good, healthy, positive, full, aligned, correct, success
   - Red = bad, depleted, negative, warning, wrong, failure
   - Yellow = caution, middle state, transition
   - Example GOOD: "Battery meter with green, yellow, and red sections" → colors show charge level
   - Example GOOD: "Green checkmark beside aligned spine" → green indicates correctness
   - Example GOOD: "Left side glowing green (good), right side colored red (bad)" → comparison

2. Natural/Inherent Colors (the object is actually that color):
   - Example GOOD: "Mint leaf with fresh green waves" → mint is naturally green
   - Example GOOD: "Lavender sprig with purple waves" → lavender is naturally purple
   - Example GOOD: "Bright green grass" → grass is naturally green

3. Brand Logos (simplified, recognizable shape only - NO exact brand colors):
   - Keep logos minimal and monochrome to match the overall simple cartoon style
   - Example GOOD: "Instagram logo icon" → just the recognizable shape
   - Example GOOD: "YouTube logo icon" → just the recognizable shape
   - Example BAD: "Instagram logo - pink and purple gradient square" → too colorful
   - Example BAD: "YouTube logo - red rounded rectangle" → unnecessary color

WHEN NOT TO USE COLOR:
1. Arbitrary Decoration:
   - Example BAD: "Golden trophy", "glowing tools" → decorative, not meaningful
   - Example BAD: "Black smartphone with glowing screen" → unnecessary glow

2. Rejection/Prohibition Symbols (the X alone conveys meaning):
   - Example BAD: "Red X marks" → just use "X marks"
   - Example BAD: "Large red X crossed through it" → just use "large X crossed through it"

3. Calendar Dates:
   - Example BAD: "Calendar page with red date circle" → just use "calendar page with date circle"
   - Dates are not inherently red

4. Checkmarks Without Comparison:
   - Example BAD: "Green checkmark" in isolation → just use "checkmark"
   - Exception: Green checkmark IS okay when directly comparing to a red X in the same scene
