Create a prompt for an AI image generator to illustrate a scene. I want scene demonstration to be simple, fun and very clear!
Follow same patterns as the attached examples.
Do not say "Same" and "or"
Be clear and visual.
Refer to the current script attached for context.

CHARACTER CONSISTENCY:
- Main character has NO description (just "cartoon person" or "standing cartoon person")
- Supporting characters (mom, mentor, soldier, etc.) must use exact descriptions from Character Reference Sheet
- Use the same character description every time that character appears

OBJECT CONSISTENCY:
- If an object appears in multiple scenes, use the EXACT same description each time
- Example: If a notepad is introduced as "white notepad with 'GOALS' written at the top in bold letters", use that exact description in ALL scenes featuring that notepad
- This applies to: notepads, phones, calendars, trophies, books, tools, and any recurring objects
- Create visual continuity so viewers recognize the same object across scenes

NO MEMORY RULE:
- The AI image generator has NO memory between scenes
- NEVER reference things vaguely like "the five steps" or "the thing from before"
- Every prompt must be FULLY SELF-CONTAINED with all necessary context
- If referencing steps, lists, or concepts from the script, explicitly state what they are
- Example BAD: "The five steps shown as blocks"
- Example GOOD: "Five blocks labeled '1. SHUT UP', '2. PICK ONE', '3. START UGLY', '4. SHOW UP', '5. UPGRADE'"

SERIES CONSISTENCY RULE:
- When consecutive sentences follow a similar pattern (e.g., "No phone", "No music", "No distractions"), ALL scenes in that series must use the SAME visual style/pattern
- Pick one visual approach and apply it consistently across the entire series
- Example: If "No phone" uses a prohibition circle with large X, then "No music" and "No distractions" must ALSO use prohibition circles with large X
- This applies to: lists, comparisons, repetitive statements, parallel structures
- Example patterns to keep consistent:
  - "Not X, Not Y, Not Z" → same rejection visual style
  - "Even when X, Even when Y" → same persistence visual style  
  - "Step 1, Step 2, Step 3" → same step introduction style
  - "They'll do X, Then they'll Y" → same prediction visual style

Answer in JSON format:
type Scene = {
  text: string;
  prompt: string;
};

type Response = {
  scenes: Scene[];
};
