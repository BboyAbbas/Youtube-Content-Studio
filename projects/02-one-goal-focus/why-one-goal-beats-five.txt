You have 5 goals for 2025? You'll achieve none of them.

Here's why. Your brain has limited willpower. Five goals means you're running at 20% power on each. One goal? 100% power.

Pick ONE thing. Not three. Not five. One.

And be specific. "Make more money" is useless. "Make $100K by December 31st"—now your brain can work with that.

The goal you're most afraid to fully commit to? That's the one that actually matters.

One goal. Full power. That's it.
