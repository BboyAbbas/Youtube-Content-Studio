      "text": "Because Cortés figured out something about the human brain that psychologists wouldn't discover for another 500 years.",
      "prompt": "Split scene on a black background. Left side: Hernán Cortés standing upright, wearing a morion helmet with red plume, full beard, metal armor with shoulder plates and arm guards, with a knowing smile, his right hand pointing to his temple. Right side: a modern scientist in white lab coat standing beside a lightbox displaying brain scans, eyes wide with surprise, mouth slightly open. A horizontal timeline arrow in white connects them at center, with the text '500 YEARS' written above the arrow. Simple cartoon style with clean lines."

    {
      "text": "And it's the same reason you can scroll TikTok for three hours but can't study for thirty minutes.",
      "prompt": "Split scene on a black background. Left side: standing cartoon person with a big smile and relaxed posture, both hands holding a smartphone, eyes fixed on screen. Above their head, a circular clock face shows '3:00' with the text '3 HOURS' beneath it. Right side: same standing cartoon person slumped forward over an open book on a desk, head resting on arms, eyes drooping with exhaustion. Above their head, a circular clock face shows '0:30' with the text '30 MIN' beneath it. Simple cartoon style with clean lines, consistent character design on both sides."

    {
      "text": "The same reason you set goals in January and forget them by February.",
      "prompt": "Split scene on a black background. Left side: standing cartoon person with excited expression, pen in right hand, actively writing on a white notepad with 'GOALS' written at the top in bold letters. Behind them, a wall calendar page shows 'JANUARY' in large text at the top. Right side: same standing cartoon person with blank confused expression, arms hanging loosely at sides. The same white notepad with 'GOALS' header lies crumpled on the floor beside their feet. Behind them, a wall calendar page shows 'FEBRUARY' in large text at the top. Simple cartoon style with clean lines, consistent character design on both sides."

    {
      "text": "The same reason you know exactly what you need to do but still don't do it.",
      "prompt": "On a black background, a standing cartoon person positioned on the right side of the frame, arms crossed tightly over chest, feet planted wide apart, chin slightly raised with a stubborn expression. On the left side, a white rectangular checklist floats in the air with three items listed: '1. EXERCISE', '2. EAT HEALTHY', '3. SLEEP EARLY', each with an empty checkbox beside it. Above the person's head, a circular thought bubble contains a glowing lightbulb, indicating they understand. Simple cartoon style with clean lines."

    {
      "text": "It's not laziness.",
      "prompt": "On a black background, centered in the frame, a cartoon figure lying horizontally on a couch with eyes closed and 'Z Z Z' floating above their head. The entire couch and figure are inside a large circular prohibition symbol (a circle with a diagonal line through it from top-left to bottom-right). Simple cartoon style with clean lines."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's not weakness.",
      "prompt": "On a black background, centered in the frame, a cartoon arm bent at the elbow in a classic flexing pose showing a bicep muscle. The entire arm is inside a large circular prohibition symbol (a circle with a diagonal line through it from top-left to bottom-right). Simple cartoon style with clean lines."

    {
      "text": "Your brain is sabotaging you.",
      "prompt": "On a black background, a cartoon brain with small stick arms and stick legs, two dot eyes and a curved mouth on the frontal lobe area, tiptoeing from left to right with a mischievous wide grin. The brain holds a gray wrench in its right hand, actively loosening a bolt on a rectangular machine on the right side of the frame. The machine has a label plate reading 'YOUR PLANS' in bold text on its front. Loose bolts and small parts scatter on the ground below. Simple cartoon style with clean lines."

    {
      "text": "On purpose.",
      "prompt": "On a black background, a close-up view of a cartoon brain filling most of the frame. The brain has small stick arms and stick legs, two narrowed dot eyes and a deliberate curved smirk on the frontal lobe area. Both small hands are pressed together in front of the brain, fingers interlaced, rubbing together in a scheming gesture. Simple cartoon style with clean lines."
    },
    {
      "text": "It has been your whole life.",
      "prompt": "On a black background, a horizontal timeline arrow stretches from left to right across the frame. Five cartoon figures are arranged in a row along the timeline, evenly spaced: a baby crawling (labeled 'BABY' beneath), a small child standing (labeled 'CHILD' beneath), a teenager (labeled 'TEEN' beneath), a young adult (labeled '20s' beneath), and an adult (labeled 'NOW' beneath). Above each figure, the same cartoon brain with small stick arms and legs, two dot eyes and a mischievous grin on the frontal lobe, hovers with identical scheming expression. Simple cartoon style with clean lines, consistent brain design across all five stages."
    },
    {
      "text": "But once you understand how, you can use that same biology against itself.",
      "prompt": "On a black background, a standing cartoon person on the left side of the frame with a clever smirk, one eyebrow raised, holding a wooden puppet control bar in both hands above their head. Four white strings extend downward from the bar to a cartoon brain with small stick arms and stick legs positioned on the right side of the frame. The brain has two wide confused dot eyes and a wavy uncertain mouth on the frontal lobe area, arms and legs dangling limply like a puppet. Simple cartoon style with clean lines."
    },
    {
      "text": "I'm going to show you five stupidly simple systems that scientists, athletes, and monks figured out.",
      "prompt": "On a black background, three figures standing upright in a row, evenly spaced from left to right. Left: a scientist in white lab coat with safety goggles pushed up on forehead, holding a glowing white orb in both hands at chest height. Center: an athlete in a gray tank top with muscular arms, holding a glowing white orb in both hands at chest height. Right: a monk in maroon and saffron yellow robes with shaved head and peaceful closed-eye expression, holding a glowing white orb in both hands at chest height. Above all three figures, the large number '5' floats centered in white text. Simple cartoon style with clean lines, consistent orb design across all three figures."
    },
    {
      "text": "Systems so simple they seem like cheating.",
      "prompt": "On a black background, a thin, small book centered in the frame with a soft white glow around its edges. The book cover reads 'SYSTEMS' in bold white text. To the right of the book, a single large cartoon eye peeks suspiciously from the edge of the frame, eyebrow raised. Above the eye, a circular thought bubble contains the text 'Too easy?' in white. Simple cartoon style with clean lines."
    },
    {
      "text": "They're not.",
      "prompt": "On a black background, large bold white text reading 'NOT CHEATING' centered in the frame. To the right of the text, a green checkmark symbol. Simple cartoon style with clean lines."
    },
    {
      "text": "They're just what schools never bothered to teach you.",
      "prompt": "On a black background, a classroom scene. A teacher figure stands on the left beside a large green chalkboard. The chalkboard has three lines of white text: 'MATH', 'ENGLISH', 'SCIENCE' written on the left half. The right half of the chalkboard is completely blank. A white arrow points to the blank section from the right side of the frame, with a large white question mark at the arrow's origin. Simple cartoon style with clean lines."
    },
    {
      "text": "Let's go back to Mexico.",
      "prompt": "On a black background, a simplified white outline map of Mexico centered on the right side of the frame. A large curved arrow in white starts from the left side of the frame and curves backward (counterclockwise) toward the map, with the arrowhead pointing at Mexico. Three short motion lines trail behind the arrow on the left, suggesting movement. The text '1519' appears in white below the map. Simple cartoon style with clean lines."
