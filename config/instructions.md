Create a prompt for an AI image generator to illustrate a scene. I want scene demonstration to be simple, fun and very clear!
Follow same patterns as the attached examples.
Do not say "Same" and "or"
Be clear and visual.
Refer to the current script attached for context.

ONE SCENE PER SENTENCE RULE:
- Each sentence in the script gets its own separate scene
- NEVER combine multiple sentences into one scene, even if they seem related
- Questions and statements should be separated, even if they're on the same topic
- Example BAD: Combining "One goal? 100% power." into one scene
- Example GOOD: "One goal?" gets one scene, "100% power." gets a separate scene
- Exception: You MAY combine consecutive related sentences into ONE split-scene comparison IF it creates stronger visual impact
  - Example: "\"Make more money\" is useless. \"Make $100K by December 31st\"—now your brain can work with that." → Can become one split scene showing bad vs good
  - Example: "Five goals means you're running at 20% power on each. One goal? 100% power." → Can become one split scene showing low vs high power
  - Only use this exception when the sentences form a clear before/after or bad/good comparison

CHARACTER CONSISTENCY:
- Main character has NO description (just "cartoon person" or "standing cartoon person")
- Supporting characters (mom, mentor, soldier, etc.) must use exact descriptions from Character Reference Sheet
- Use the same character description every time that character appears

OBJECT CONSISTENCY:
- If an object appears in multiple scenes, use the EXACT same description each time
- Example: If a notepad is introduced as "white notepad with 'GOALS' written at the top in bold letters", use that exact description in ALL scenes featuring that notepad
- This applies to: notepads, phones, calendars, trophies, books, tools, and any recurring objects
- Create visual continuity so viewers recognize the same object across scenes

NO MEMORY RULE:
- The AI image generator has NO memory between scenes
- NEVER reference things vaguely like "the five steps" or "the thing from before"
- Every prompt must be FULLY SELF-CONTAINED with all necessary context
- If referencing steps, lists, or concepts from the script, explicitly state what they are
- Example BAD: "The five steps shown as blocks"
- Example GOOD: "Five blocks labeled '1. SHUT UP', '2. PICK ONE', '3. START UGLY', '4. SHOW UP', '5. UPGRADE'"

SERIES CONSISTENCY RULE:
- When consecutive sentences follow a similar pattern (e.g., "No phone", "No music", "No distractions"), ALL scenes in that series must use the SAME visual style/pattern
- Pick one visual approach and apply it consistently across the entire series
- Example: If "No phone" uses a prohibition circle with large X, then "No music" and "No distractions" must ALSO use prohibition circles with large X
- This applies to: lists, comparisons, repetitive statements, parallel structures
- Example patterns to keep consistent:
  - "Not X, Not Y, Not Z" → same rejection visual style
  - "Even when X, Even when Y" → same persistence visual style  
  - "Step 1, Step 2, Step 3" → same step introduction style
  - "They'll do X, Then they'll Y" → same prediction visual style

COLOR USAGE RULES:
- Use color ONLY when it carries semantic meaning or represents the object's natural color
- NEVER use color for decoration or emphasis alone

WHEN TO USE COLOR:
1. Semantic/Functional Meaning:
   - Green = good, healthy, positive, full, aligned, correct, success
   - Red = bad, depleted, negative, warning, wrong, failure
   - Yellow = caution, middle state, transition
   - Example GOOD: "Battery meter with green, yellow, and red sections" → colors show charge level
   - Example GOOD: "Green checkmark beside aligned spine" → green indicates correctness
   - Example GOOD: "Left side glowing green (good), right side colored red (bad)" → comparison

2. Natural/Inherent Colors (the object is actually that color):
   - Example GOOD: "Mint leaf with fresh green waves" → mint is naturally green
   - Example GOOD: "Lavender sprig with purple waves" → lavender is naturally purple
   - Example GOOD: "Bright green grass" → grass is naturally green

3. Brand Logos (simplified, recognizable shape only - NO exact brand colors):
   - Keep logos minimal and monochrome to match the overall simple cartoon style
   - Example GOOD: "Instagram logo icon" → just the recognizable shape
   - Example GOOD: "YouTube logo icon" → just the recognizable shape
   - Example BAD: "Instagram logo - pink and purple gradient square" → too colorful
   - Example BAD: "YouTube logo - red rounded rectangle" → unnecessary color

WHEN NOT TO USE COLOR:
1. Arbitrary Decoration:
   - Example BAD: "Golden trophy", "glowing tools" → decorative, not meaningful
   - Example BAD: "Black smartphone with glowing screen" → unnecessary glow

2. Rejection/Prohibition Symbols (the X alone conveys meaning):
   - Example BAD: "Red X marks" → just use "X marks"
   - Example BAD: "Large red X crossed through it" → just use "large X crossed through it"

3. Calendar Dates:
   - Example BAD: "Calendar page with red date circle" → just use "calendar page with date circle"
   - Dates are not inherently red

4. Checkmarks Without Comparison:
   - Example BAD: "Green checkmark" in isolation → just use "checkmark"
   - Exception: Green checkmark IS okay when directly comparing to a red X in the same scene

FULL EXAMPLE OF CORRECT COLOR USAGE IN COMPARISON SCENE:
"Split scene. Left side: standing cartoon person slumped over with exhausted defeated expression, a to-do list with X marks glowing red floating above them. Right side: successful person with round head, short neat hair with a few strands on top, simple dot eyes, small curved smile, wearing plain t-shirt, standing confidently beside a trophy and stack of books, a to-do list with checkmarks glowing green floating above them. Simple cartoon style with clean lines."
→ Red and green are used semantically to show bad vs good outcomes in direct comparison

"Split scene. Left side: five small battery icons each with 5 bars total and only 1 bar filled glowing red, five tiny flags labeled 'GOAL' above them. Right side: single large battery icon with 5 bars total and all 5 bars filled glowing green, one large flag labeled 'GOAL' above it. Simple cartoon style"
→ Red and green show depleted vs full power in direct comparison

PROMPT QUALITY GUIDELINES (Bad vs Good Prompting):

These rules ensure AI-generated images are consistent, accurate, and match your vision:

1. SPECIFY EXACT COLORS:
   - BAD: "simple robes"
   - GOOD: "maroon and saffron yellow robes"
   - Never leave clothing, objects, or key elements with vague color descriptions

2. DESCRIBE EXACT POSES AND BODY POSITIONS:
   - BAD: "monk figure"
   - GOOD: "monk figure seated in a classic meditation pose (cross-legged on the ground with hands resting on knees)"
   - Include hand placement, leg position, and body orientation

3. SPECIFY ELEMENT PLACEMENT IN FRAME:
   - BAD: "with the word 'FOCUS' crossed out"
   - GOOD: "The word 'FOCUS' appears above their head and is crossed out"
   - Always state WHERE text, symbols, and objects appear (above, below, left, right, center)

4. ALWAYS SPECIFY BACKGROUND:
   - BAD: No background mentioned
   - GOOD: "on a black background" or "on a white background"
   - Never assume the AI will choose an appropriate background

5. USE EXACT QUANTITIES AND SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT:
   - BAD: "A timeline showing years of meditation"
   - GOOD: "four monk figures arranged in a row, evenly spaced"
   - Specify exact numbers and how elements are positioned relative to each other

6. EXPLICITLY PLACE LABELS AND TEXT:
   - BAD: "At the end, their nervous system glows"
   - GOOD: "labeled '1 YEAR,' '5 YEARS,' and '10 YEARS' centered beneath each one"
   - Describe exactly where text labels appear and their formatting

7. DESCRIBE HOW ABSTRACT CONCEPTS ARE VISUALIZED:
   - BAD: "nervous system diagram glows with transformation"
   - GOOD: "the head is transparent, revealing a detailed illustration of a brain and nervous system glowing with a soft white light"
   - Break down abstract ideas into concrete visual descriptions

8. REQUEST CHARACTER CONSISTENCY EXPLICITLY:
   - BAD: No mention of consistency
   - GOOD: "consistent character design across all four figures"
   - When multiple characters or repeated elements appear, explicitly request visual consistency

9. DESCRIBE SHAPES CONTAINING TEXT:
   - BAD: "An arrow from 'MOTIVATION' pointing toward 'REPETITION'"
   - GOOD: "On the left, an oval shape contains the word 'MOTIVATION' in white, outlined text. A line extends from this oval..."
   - Specify the shape (oval, rectangle, circle), its style (outlined, filled), and text formatting

10. USE MEANINGFUL COLORS FOR SYMBOLS:
    - BAD: "with a checkmark"
    - GOOD: "a green checkmark symbol"
    - Add color to symbols when the color carries meaning (green = correct, red = wrong)

11. DESCRIBE VISUAL CONNECTIONS, NOT ACTIONS:
    - BAD: "Brain scanning equipment creates images of brain activity. Scientists observe the data."
    - GOOD: "They wear a cap with electrodes. A white line extends from the cap to the figure on the right."
    - Show the physical visual link between elements, not abstract actions like "creates" or "observes"

12. DEFINE GAUGE/METER COMPONENTS:
    - BAD: "motivation meters showing the same level"
    - GOOD: "semicircular dial with three colored segments: red on the left, yellow in the middle, and teal on the right. A gray needle points towards the teal segment"
    - Specify shape (semicircular, vertical bar), color segments, needle position, and label formatting

13. REMOVE EDITORIAL COMMENTARY:
    - BAD: "The difference is microscopic." or "The trying is absent."
    - GOOD: Just describe the visual elements without explaining what they mean
    - Show, don't tell. Let the image speak for itself.

14. REPLACE ABSTRACT VERBS WITH POSES:
    - BAD: "Standing cartoon person shown transforming"
    - GOOD: "cartoon person in a dramatic ascending pose: body arched gracefully backward, head tilted up toward the sky, arms relaxed and slightly outstretched to the sides, legs trailing below as if floating"
    - Abstract verbs like "transforming", "evolving", "changing" must become specific body positions

15. ADD VISUAL EFFECTS FOR EMOTIONAL IMPACT:
    - BAD: "The person evolved to match the challenge"
    - GOOD: "Sparkles and small glowing particles scatter around the figure in all directions"
    - Use sparkles, glow, particles, motion lines to convey emotion and transformation

QUALITY CHECKLIST FOR EVERY PROMPT:
□ Specific colors mentioned for all key elements
□ Exact pose/position described (not just "standing" or "sitting")
□ Background explicitly stated
□ All text/labels have placement (above, below, beside)
□ Quantities are exact numbers, not vague ("three" not "several")
□ Shapes described (oval, square, circle) for containers
□ Consistency requested when multiple similar elements appear
□ Abstract concepts broken into concrete visual elements
□ Visual connections shown (lines, arrows) not abstract actions
□ No editorial commentary—show, don't tell
□ Visual effects added for emotional moments (sparkles, glow, particles)
