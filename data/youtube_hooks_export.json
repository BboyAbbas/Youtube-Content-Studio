      "hook_full_transcript": "what happens if someone keeps telling you that you're insane at first you'd reject it you know who you are you trust your own mind but over time something shifts maybe you are a difficult person maybe you do overreact maybe you're not as rational as you thought and if enough doubt Creeps in you might start believing the one thing you never thought possible maybe they're right this is gaslighting a psychological weapon designed to make you question your own perception of reality it's not just lying it's erasing truth itself and replacing it with something more convenient for the manipulator and the worst part by the time you realize what's happening if you ever do you're already trapped the term comes from a 1944 film Gaslight where a husband slowly convinces his wife that she's is losing her mind he dims the lights in their home then denies that anything has changed when she notices the goal to make her doubt herself so completely that she becomes dependent on him but this isn't just a movie Trope it's a real world manipulation tactic used in toxic relationships Cults politics and even corporations gaslighting works because it destabilizes reality itself it starts subtly the manipulator denies things they've said or done even when there's proof I never said that you're making things up at first you argue back but over time hearing the same denials over and over chips away at your confidence next they attack your ability to think clearly you're always so dramatic you overanalyze everything soon you start doubting your own judgment convincing yourself that maybe you are the problem then comes emotional manipulation any reaction you have is dismissed why are you so sensitive you always blow things out of proportion the goal is to make you question your right to feel the way you do eventually you start second guessing your own emotions apologizing when you shouldn't and then the final step isolation gaslighters don't want you hearing outside perspectives so they slowly cut you off from other influences they tell you your friends are making you paranoid that your family doesn't really understand you bit by bit they become the sole Authority on what's real at this stage they don't need to manipulate you anymore you do it to yourself you stop questioning them you silence your own doubts before they even have a chance to surface you accept their version of events not because you want to but because your mind no longer trusts itself to disagree gaslighting is terrifying because it doesn't just manip at your thoughts it rewrites who you are it makes you abandon yourself handing over control to someone else without even realizing it and by the time you finally see the truth if you ever do it feels impossible to break free because how do you fight back when you don't even know what's real anymore brainwashing in today's world we see many people so brainwashed that they may seem completely disconnected from reality they believe the unbelievable defend the indefensible and reject even the most obvious truths but how does someone get to this point what exactly is brainwashing and what are the practical steps that make such a radical transformation possible brainwashing isn't just an idea from dystopian fiction it's one of the most powerful and effective psychological manipulations in history and the terrifying part no one is truly immune to it one of the most chilling real world examples the Jonestown massacre in 1978 over 900 people including children died after drinking cyanide laced punch under the orders of cult leader Jim Jones this wasn't a group of people who suddenly decided to follow a Madman they were conditioned step by step until their critical thinking was completely overridden they truly believed they were making their own choices that's the power of brainwashing it doesn't force you to change it makes you want to so how does it actually happen it follows a pattern isolation destabilization indoctrination and reinforcement a process so effective that once it takes hold escaping feels impossible the first step is isolation when you control the information someone has access to you control their perception of reality Jim Jones did this by moving his followers to a remote compound in Guyana cutting them off from outside influences in everyday life this happens in media bubbles extremist groups and even in toxic relationships where only one perspective is constantly reinforced the more someone's worldview is shaped by a single Source the less they question it next comes destabilization breaking down a person's mental defenses this is done through exhaustion fear and confusion Cults use long sermons erratic punishments and emotional breakdowns governments use constant crisis narratives making people feel like the world is too chaotic to understand without their Guidance the more mentally drained someone becomes the more they rely on the manipulator to make sense of things for them then comes indoctrination implanting new beliefs the key here is reward and Punishment Cycles if you conform you're praised if you question you're punished in Cults doubting the leader means Exile in real life questioning certain ideologies can get you socially ostracized over time this conditioning rewires the brain making the new belief feel natural even when it was forced upon you finally there's reinforcement once brainwashing is complete the new identity is constantly reinforced through rituals group think and identity-based loyalty people stop questioning because their beliefs are now tied to their sense of self they don't feel brainwashed they feel enlightened and that's the scariest part brainwashing doesn't feel like brainwashing when it's happening to you it feels like truth that's why people stay in abusive groups fall for Mass manipulation and follow ideologies to extremes without ever questioning them so how do you protect yourself the first step is awareness brainwashing works by making critical thinking feel unnecessary or even dangerous the moment you feel pressured not to question something that's a red flag the second step is exposure to multiple perspectives if you only ever hear one side of a story you are being controlled even if you don't realize it and the third step pay attention to emotional manipulation fear guilt outrage these are the tools used to override logic whenever your emotions are being used to shape your your beliefs stop and ask yourself who benefits from me thinking this way because once your mind is Rewritten you won't even realize it happened love bombing at first it feels like something out of a movie the attention is intoxicating the affection is overwhelming you finally found someone who sees you really sees you they flood you with compliments send constant texts tell you your special that they've never met anyone like you it's intense exhilarating almost too perfect and that's because it is this is love bombing a psychological trick designed to make someone emotionally dependent before pulling the rug out from under them it's not about genuine affection it's a setup a carefully crafted illusion love bombing works by hijacking the brain's reward system when someone floods you with extreme positivity your brain releases dopamine the same neurotransmitter involved in addiction it's a high an emotional Rush that feels impossible to walk away from and that's exactly the point in relationships it might look like extravagant gifts rushing intimacy or intense Declarations of Love after only a few days in friendships or workplaces it's an instant connection Relentless praise and flattery that feels almost surreal but the real trick isn't in the excess it's in the reversal because once the the victim is hooked the withdrawal Begins the good morning texts stop the warmth Fades the compliments turn into cold indifference or Worse criticism suddenly the person who made you feel like the most special person in the world pulls away leaving you scrambling to understand what went wrong and here's where the real manipulation happens instead of recognizing the pattern the victim blames themselves they analyze every conversation lower their boundaries and work harder to fix what they think they did wrong they chase the affection not realizing that the honeymoon phase was never real to begin with this cycle intense affection followed by sudden emotional starvation is a psychological trap it's called intermittent reinforcement the same mechanism that makes gambling so addictive the victim never knows when the affection will return so they keep chasing it tolerating worse and worse treatment just for another hit of that early Euphoria it's a tactic used by narcissists in relationships by Cult leaders to keep followers obedient even by toxic workplaces to manipulate employees into loyalty the unpredictability creates an emotional roller coaster where the victim is so focused on regaining the high that they don't realize how much control they've lost by the time they see the the pattern it's already too late they're exhausted isolated doubting their own instincts guilt tripping there's a way to control someone without Force without threats without a single raised voice you don't have to argue persuade or command all you have to do is make them feel guilty guilt tripping and shame inducement are some of the most powerful psychological weapons capable of turning people into puppets without them ever realizing it the victim believes they're acting out of free will when in reality their emotions are being manipulated like strings on a marionette think about it how many times have you done something not because you wanted to but because you felt bad if you didn't maybe you agreed to a favor even though you were exhausted maybe you apologized for something that wasn't your fault maybe you stayed in a toxic relationship because leaving would make you feel like a ter able person that's guilt tripping in action and it's terrifyingly effective the trick is simple first the manipulator plants the seed of guilt subtly twisting reality to make the victim feel responsible for their suffering a parent sigh after everything I've done for you this is how you treat me a friend says I guess I just don't matter to you anymore a partner says I sacrifice so much for this relationship and you're just just going to walk away none of these statements directly tell the victim what to do they don't have to the guilt does all the work but guilt alone isn't always enough that's where shame inducement comes in guilt makes you feel bad about something you did shame makes you feel bad about who you are it's not you forgot my birthday it's you're a terrible friend it's not you made a mistake at work it's you're completely in competent when someone internalizes shame they stop fighting back they don't just feel like they did something wrong they feel like they are wrong and that is the ultimate form of control cult leaders abusive Partners manipulative bosses they all use this tactic to break people down to make them easier to control if you can convince someone that they are inherently flawed that they owe you something that they are never quite good enough then they will spend their lives trying to prove otherwise they will stay in situations they should leave agree to things they don't want and Chase approval that will never truly be given but here's the scariest part guilt tripping doesn't just come from other people we learn to do it to ourselves we hear these voices so often that they become part of our own inner dialogue I shouldn't say no I should be a better person I don't deserve to be happy and once someone starts shaming themselves the manipulation is complete they no longer need anyone else to control them so how do you break free the first step is recognizing the pattern ask yourself are you doing something because you truly want to or because you're afraid of being seen as selfish ungrateful or a disappointment are you accepting blame that isn't yours are you constantly trying to earn approval that keeps moving just Out Of Reach once you start questioning the guilt you strip it of its power because the truth is no one else gets to decide your worth and the moment you stop playing their game the spell is broken cultivating dependence there's a reason cult leaders abusive partners and authoritarian regimes rarely use physical chains they don't need to the most effective way to control someone isn't to lock them up it's to make them believe they can't survive without you this is the Dark Art of engineered dependence a psychological trick designed to make people abandon their own independence willingly handing over control to someone else and it works because it Taps into something fundamental the human need for connection it starts with removing options one by one not through Force but through subtle manipulation a partner insists your friends don't really care about you a group warns your family is toxic you need to cut them out a leader Whispers only we know the truth the outside world is dangerous at first it feels like a suggestion but soon it becomes a rule then a belief until one day you look around and realize there's no one left once isolation is complete dependence takes over the manipulator becomes the only source of validation a approval Security even basic needs they create problems only they can solve they withhold kindness until obedience is guaranteed in extreme cases they control finances decisions even movement the victim stops making choices for themselves not because they don't want to but because they've been conditioned to believe they can't and here's the cruestv thinks it's their choice they aren't locked away they aren't physically restrained but they stay because their world has been Rewritten so completely that leaving feels like stepping off a cliff this method has been used throughout history Cults sever members from friends and family making the leader their only trusted source of Truth abusive Partners erode self-confidence until their victim believes they are nothing without them totalitarian governments censor information in uring their citizens feel powerless without the system that controls them and once someone has been broken down like this they don't need to be forced to stay they will choose to even when Escape is possible even when the doors are wide open they hesitate because when your identity has been shaped around someone else's control Freedom doesn't feel like Freedom it feels like a threat learned helplessness in 1973 Patty Hurst a wealthy was kidnapped by a militant group called The symbionese Liberation Army At first she resisted she was beaten locked in a dark closet and isolated for weeks but then something terrifying happened months later she was seen holding a gun robbing a bank alongside her captors the world was stunned how does someone go from being a victim to willingly committing crimes with the very people who tortured them this wasn't just a hostage situation it was a textbook case of psychological breakdown it starts with breaking a person down when someone is placed in a situation where they experience repeated punishment failure or isolation their mind adapts in a disturbing way they stop seeing Escape as an option even when the door is wide open they don't run this isn't just a theory psychologists first discovered it in an experiment with dogs they plac the animals in cages with electric flaws at first the dogs tried to escape but after being shocked repeatedly with no way out they gave up and here's the terrifying part when the cage door was finally opened they still didn't leave they had learned helplessness this is what makes victims of manipulation stay even when a way out exists how does this happen to people it begins with unpredictable reward and Punishment one day the captor is kind the next they're cruel the victim never knows what to expect their brain becomes stuck in survival mode too exhausted to fight back then comes self-doubt the manipulator chips away at the victim's ability to think for themselves they're told they're weak foolish incapable slowly their confidence erodes to nothing eventually they begin to believe they need their abuser to survive next is isolation friends family outside perspectives all cut off without anyone to remind them of who they were before their world shrinks their thoughts become controlled by their captor and finally forced dependence the victim relies on their abuser for food shelter even basic human Connection by this stage they might not just accept their captivity they might defend it just like Patty Hurst Ed they don't just stay they become active participants in their own entament this is why people remain in abusive relationships why prisoners of War form emotional bonds with their captors and why High control groups keep their members submissive it's not weakness it's not stupidity it's survival the brain prioritizes safety over Freedom when someone is trained to believe Escape is impossible they won't even try and that's what makes learned helplessness so terrifying the most dangerous thing a manipulator steals isn't someone's Freedom it's their belief that freedom was ever possible in the first place Stockholm syndrome there's a moment in every hostage situation where the victim should fear their captor hate them fight them do whatever it takes to escape but sometimes something strange happens instead the victim starts defending them trusting them even even loving them it sounds impossible but it's not the name Stockholm syndrome comes from a 1973 bank robbery in Stockholm Sweden four hostages were locked inside a vault for 6 days terrified and Powerless when the police finally rescued them something bizarre happened instead of thanking their saviors the hostages defended their captors one even raised money for their legal defense the world was baffled how could victims side with the very people who threatened their lives but this wasn't an isolated case it happens in kidnappings Cults abusive relationships even prisoner of war camps and the reason why is terrifying Stockholm syndrome isn't about weakness it's about survival when a person is trapped and Powerless their brain stops looking for ways to fight and starts looking for ways to cope the capter controls everything food movement even whether they live or die and in that situation the Mind does something disturbing it rewires fear into attachment it starts with small acts of Mercy a kidnapper allows their Hostage to eat an abuser apologizes after an outburst a cult leader offers protection from an outside threat these tiny gestures create a twisted reality the victims start seeing their captor as their savior not their oppressor because when someone is both the source of your fear and your comfort your mind clings to the Comfort then comes isolation the victim is cut off from the outside world forced to rely only on their captor words over time their own sense of self erodes they stop questioning they start justifying this is why abuse victims often defend their abusers why hostages sometimes refuse to escape even when given the chance it's not about logic it's about survival and finally dependency locks the victim into place when their only way to stay safe is to keep their cap happy they stop resisting they start working for them instead of against them they might even feel gratitude loyalty love this is why Stockholm syndrome is so terrifying it proves just how fragile human perception can be the mind will betray itself to survive twisting reality until captors become protectors and victims defend their own suffering and the worst part most people don't even realize it's happening until it's too late memory manipulation what if I told you that some of your memories the moments you swear happened exactly as you recall might be completely false that someone could plant a memory in your mind and you would believe it just as firmly as your real experiences it sounds like like science fiction but in reality memory is one of the most fragile easily manipulated aspects of the human mind and that makes it a perfect tool for control take the infamous lost in the mall experiment by psychologist Elizabeth Loftus participants were told stories about their childhood some real some completely fabricated one of them was simple as a child they had once been lost in a shopping mall at first the subjects had no memory of this but after repeated questioning and subtle suggestions many of them began remembering details who found them what the mall looked like how they felt they swore it had happened even though it never did their minds had filled in the blanks constructing a completely false memory this wasn't just people misremembering this was memory being Rewritten our brains don't store memories like a camera capturing moments in perfect clarity instead every time we recall an event we reconstruct it pulling together fragments filling in gaps and without realizing it changing the details and here's the terrifying part the more you recall a memory the less accurate it becomes this means that with the right influence someone can alter your past they can change how you remember events reshape your emotions and even convince you of things that never happened one of the easiest ways to manipulate memory is through suggestion a simple phrase like are you sure that's what happened or I remember it differently introduces doubt your brain wanting to maintain consistency starts adjusting its recoil to match the new version of events over time you adopt the false memory as your own then comes reinforcement if multiple people confirm the false memory whether they're lying or just misremembering it becomes reality social agreement is one of the most powerful tools for shaping memory because the brain values Collective certainty over individual doubt if everyone else remembers it that way maybe you're the one who's wrong and this isn't just some harmless Quirk of the Mind history has seen terrifying uses of memory manipulation false confessions in criminal cases have been extracted by police interrogators reconstructing events until the accused believes in their own guilt in abusive relationships manipulative Partners rewrite history convincing victims they were at fault for things they never did governments and propaganda machines have altered historical narratives reshaping public perception to serve their agendas memory is the foundation of identity it shapes who we are what we believe and how we see the world but what happens when someone else takes control of it if your past can be Rewritten then so can your future and by the time you realize your mind has been altered if you ever do it's already too late fear mongering fear is the oldest form of control it overrides logic crushes independent thought and turns people into willing followers when someone is afraid they don't analyze they don't question they just want to feel safe and that's what makes fear-mongering and anxiety induction one of the most dangerous psychological tricks ever used history is filled with examples of fear being weaponized to control entire populations one of the most infamous the Salem witch trials in the late 1600s paranoia gripped an entire town people believed witches were lurking among them hiding in plain sight the fear became so overwhelming that neighbors turned against neighbors accusations spread like wildfire and logic ceased to exist people confess to crimes they never committed just to avoid execution and those who didn't confess they were sentenced to death anyway fear didn't just manipulate them it made them destroy themselves and you don't need a Witch Hunt for this trick to work it happens everywhere a manipulative boss keeps employees Terri horrified of losing their jobs so they never complain an abusive partner convinces someone the world outside is dangerous so they never leave politicians and media Outlets use fear constantly telling people that disaster is imminent their way of life is under attack and only one person one system one ideology can protect them and the more afraid you are the more control they have this works because fear hijacks the brain when you're an anxious you're amydala the part of the brain that processes threats goes into survival mode logical thinking shuts down and you become hyperfocused on avoiding danger in that moment whoever offers you a way out whether it's a leader a product or a belief system becomes the person you cling to for security this is why fear-based marketing is so effective ads don't just sell products they sell protection without this cream you'll age faster without this insurance you'll be ruined without this security system you won't be safe in your own home the fear is planted and the solution is immediately presented the most terrifying part fear-driven manipulation doesn't feel like manipulation it doesn't come with a warning label it feels like concern like preparation like a necessary precaution but if someone is constantly feeding your fears keeping you anxious and offering themselves as the only solution step back and ask why because the moment fear stops being a warning and starts being a leash someone else is holding the other end emotional blackmail this psychological trick is so powerful that it can make people betray their values stay in toxic relationships and feel trapped in their own lives it's not hypnosis it's not mind control it's something worse and the scariest part most people don't even realize it's happening to them picture this a mother tells her child if you leave me and move away I don't know how I'll survive a partner says if you really loved me you wouldn't question me a friend warns after everything I've done for you you owe me these aren't just guilt trips they're calculated forms of control this is emotional blackmail a psychological manipulation Tac where someone exploits your emotions fear guilt and obligation to get what they want they don't ask they don't force instead they make you feel like denying them is cruel selfish even dangerous and before you know it you're doing things you never wanted to do because saying no feels impossible and this trick isn't just used by individuals entire groups and movements have been built on emotional blackmail take organized crime mob bosses have used this tactic for decades a perfect example the mafia they don't just rely on threats of violence they manipulate loyalty Family Ties and unspoken debts to keep members obedient a small favor is granted an act of generosity extended but there's an unspoken rule refusing to reciprocate is betrayal the idea of walking away isn't just dangerous it's made to feel morally wrong that's how deep emotional blackmail can go but it doesn't take a crime syndicate to use this trick it happens everywhere in relationships where one partner constantly threatens to leave if they don't get their way in families where one person controls everyone else through outbursts and silent treatment at work where employees are made to feel guilty for setting boundaries and it always follows a pattern first the manipulator makes a Dem subtle or direct they want something from you but instead of asking they set a trap next they trigger guilt fear or obligation maybe they act hurt maybe they explode in Anger maybe they withdraw affection finally they offer you a way out if you just do what I say everything will be fine and just like that you're trapped not because you can't say no but because it feels like saying no will destroy everything so how do you break free it starts with recognition if someone makes you feel like your emotions are being used against you step back if setting a boundary results in threats guilt tripping or emotional punishment you're being manipulated and the key to Breaking Free isn't arguing justifying or explaining it's refusing to play the game and here's the chilling truth emotional blackmailers don't want love fairness or respect they want control and the moment they realize they can't control you anymore they either escalate their tactics or move on to their next victim playing on insecurities everyone has insecurities small Whispers of doubt that creep into the back of your mind am I good enough do they really like me what if I fail now imagine someone knowing exactly what those insecurities are and us them to control you this is one of the darkest psychological tricks weaponizing insecurities to manipulate behavior and it happens everywhere in relationships in workplaces in politics even in the ads you see every day one of the most infamous examples Bernie made off's Ponzi scheme he didn't just steal billions he exploited his victims deepest fears he prayed on Wealthy investors who feared missing out he made them feel special chosen part of an exclusive club and once he had them hooked he used their greed self-doubt and desire for status against them the result people kept giving him money even when the red flags were right in front of them that's how this trick works it starts by identifying someone's deepest fears or desires then twisting them a romantic partner subtly makes you feel unattractive so you seek their validation a boss hints that you're repl placeable so you work harder for Less a friend constantly reminds you of your past failures to keep you in check the goal to make you dependent dependent on their reassurance their approval their protection and here's why it's so effective insecurities Cloud judgment when someone makes you feel like you're not good enough you start to second guess yourself you become more willing to prove your worth even at your own expense and the worst part they control the supply of validation they can give it take it away and make you work even harder to earn it back social media is a breeding ground for this manipulation algorithms thrive on insecurity feeding you ads that make you feel unattractive unsuccessful or like you're falling behind influencers curate lives designed to make yours feel less exciting companies sell you solutions to problems you didn't even know you had until they pointed them out but it's not just corporations that use this trick it happens in families friendships and relationships a toxic parent constantly reminding their child that they'd be nothing without them a jealous friend downplaying your achievements so you never feel truly successful a partner chipping away at your confidence making you feel lucky to have them over time these tactics break people down making them easier to control so how do you fight back first recognize the pattern if someone's words or actions make you feel small uncertain or like you have something to prove take a step back are they actually trying to help you grow or are they making you dependent on their validation second rebuild your confidence outside their influence the less power someone has over your selfworth the harder it is for them to manipulate you and finally remember this no one who truly cares about you will ever use your insecurities against you because the most dangerous thing about this trick isn't just that people fall for it it's that they often don't even realize it's happening until it's too late triangulation a psychological trick so subtle it can turn the most confident person into an anxious wreck it makes people question their worth their relationships and even their grip on reality without them ever realizing it's happening this is triangulation and jealousy induction one of the most effective manipulation tactics used in toxic relationships workplaces and even politics at its core triangulation is about introducing a third person real or imagined into a dynamic to create tension competition or insecurity it's a classic move in manipulative relationships ship a controlling partner casually mentions how attractive or successful someone else is they compare their victim to an ex implying they aren't measuring up sometimes they even fabricate outside interest just to provoke a reaction it doesn't seem like direct manipulation at first it's just a comment just a story just a harmless observation but over time it changes everything because the victim starts to compete for validation they feel feel replaceable they work harder to prove themselves they stop focusing on whether the relationship is healthy and start obsessing over how to be good enough jealousy induction is the next step instead of just mentioning a third party the manipulator actively stirs doubt and insecurity they flirt in front of their partner they praise someone else successively they make sure their victim sees the attention they supposedly receive and with every calculated move the victim grows more desperate for reassurance because the more unstable they feel the easier they are to control and this isn't just in romantic relationships it happens everywhere in workplaces a toxic boss pits employees against each other constantly favoring one person over the rest to keep everyone on edge in families a parent Compares their children creating rivalry instead of connection in politics leaders divide people into factions turning them against each other to maintain power but why does it work because humans are wired for social validation when someone we care about or respect suddenly introduces competition our brains go into survival mode We crave reassurance we want to be chosen and that desperation makes us vulnerable willing to do anything to regain favor the true danger of triangulation is how it rewires thinking it shifts the victim's Focus from is this relationship good for me to what can I do to be good enough it Fosters paranoia self-doubt and emotional dependence all while making the manipulator seem desirable powerful or in control so how do you stop it first recognize the pattern if someone is making you feel like you're in constant competition step back and ask who benefits from this healthy Rel relationships don't require you to prove your worth against someone else second refuse to play the game the moment you stop reacting the manipulator loses power and finally prioritize selfworth the stronger your sense of value the harder it is for someone to manipulate you with comparison and jealousy at its core triangulation is a game of control designed to keep people emotionally unstable and seeking approval but once you see it for for what it is you don't have to play and the moment you refuse to play the game is over public shaming for centuries public shaming has been one of the most effective tools of control it can strip a person of their dignity isolate them from their community and turn them into a cautionary tale whether it's a medieval village Gathering to mock a criminal in the stocks or a social media mob tearing apart someone's reputation the psychology behind it Remains the Same public shaming isn't just about punishment it's about breaking a person down so completely that they accept their own destruction one of the most infamous examples the Salem witch trials in 1692 innocent people mostly women were dragged into the public eye accused of being witches and forced to confess under extreme pressure the accusations weren't built on evidence but on fear hysteria and the overwhelming power of public condemnation once someone became a Target their fate was sealed because when a crowd forms reason disappears but why does public humiliation work so well the answer lies in one of our deepest most Primal human fears social rejection humans are wired for connection we survive in groups to be cast out means danger in ancient times Exile from a tribe was often a death sentence and while today's world may not physically Exile people public humiliation triggers the same biological Terror the fear of being completely alone despised and Powerless and it doesn't just happen on a massive scale it happens everywhere in workplaces where a boss ridicules an employee in front of others in classrooms where a student is shamed for making a mistake in relationships where one partner humiliates the other in front of friends it's a power move designed to make the victim feel small weak and dependent on the person or group that shamed them and here's where the psychological trap deepens after the humiliation many victims seek approval from their abuser instead of fighting back they try to regain acceptance making them even easier to manipulate and now social media has taken public shaming to a new level a single mistake a poorly worded tweet a misunderstood joke within hours thousands of strangers become judges juries and executioners the larger the crowd the less individual responsibility anyone feels it becomes a Feeding Frenzy of outrage and once someone has been branded as bad the internet rarely forgives but public shaming isn't just about punishing individuals it's about controlling everyone else when someone is humiliated in front of others it sends a warning step out of line and this could be you it is enforces social norms not necessarily because they're right but because the fear of humiliation is stronger than the will to resist so how do you protect yourself against public shaming the first step is to recognize its purpose it is designed to control you through fear the moment you understand that the power of Shame begins to weaken refusing to engage with it standing your ground and rejecting the guilt trap are the strongest ways to break free because the true trick of public humiliation is that it relies on one thing your belief that you deserve it and the moment you stop believing that the spell is broken hoovering one of the most deceptive tricks in psychological manipulation doesn't come in the form of anger or threats it doesn't push you away it pulls you back in just when you're about to break free this is hoovering a tactic designed to suck you back into a toxic cycle right when you think it's over the term comes from the Hoover vacuum cleaner because that's exactly what this manipulation does it sucks you back in just as you're gaining distance it's used by narcissists emotional abusers and manipulators who can't stand losing control and the trick works because it prays on hope the hope that things will finally be different this time a textbook example Charles Manson and his cult followers when me members of his family tried to leave he didn't always use threats instead he lured them back in with affection validation and a false sense of belonging he made them feel special Irreplaceable and convinced them the world outside would never understand them the way he did the goal wasn't just to bring them back it was to make them willingly surrender control all over again but how exactly does hoovering work it's never just one approach the love bomb Hoover the manipulator suddenly floods you with affection they say they've changed they remember your favorite songs send nostalgic messages remind you of the good times they become the person you always wish they were but only for as long as it takes to get you back the pity Hoover if love doesn't work guilt is next they claim they're struggling maybe they're depressed sick or going through a crisis they make you feel responsible for their suffering they don't ask you to come back outright but they make sure you feel like a bad person if you don't the anger Hoover and if guilt fails they lash out they blame you call you heartless try to make you jealous by posting about how much happier they are without you but the goal isn't to move on it's to provoke a reaction any reaction to keep you emotionally hooked and here's why it works the brain craves closure every moment of kind kindness makes you forget the cruelty every moment of Cruelty makes you crave the kindness again it's not a single manipulation it's a pattern a push and pull cycle designed to keep you from ever fully letting go so how do you protect yourself recognize hoovering for what it is not a genuine attempt to reconnect but a tactic of control the second you see it for what it is it loses its power block contact cut the ties complete don't engage not even to explain why hoovering only works when there's a response without one the manipulator loses their grip because walking away is hard but staying in the cycle that's where the real danger lies and the only way to win don't play the game cognitive dissonance people will defend something even when it's wrong even when it hurts them even when real ity is screaming at them to stop but this isn't just stubbornness it's a psychological trap a mental Battlefield where without even realizing it you're forced to justify your own suffering this is cognitive dissonance amplification one of the most dangerous manipulation tactics designed to make people double down instead of walk away cognitive dissonance happens when someone holds two conflicting beliefs at the same time it creates an unbearable tension in the mind mind a deep unsettling discomfort that we are hardwired to resolve imagine being loyal to a leader a relationship or an ideology only to be confronted with undeniable proof that it's harmful corrupt or even false The Logical response leave the real response most people don't instead they dig in deeper they justify they twist reality to fit what they want to believe because admitting the truth would mean admitting they wasted time energy even their entire identity on something that wasn't real and that's too painful to accept one of the most extreme examples the heaven Gate cult this group believed they would Ascend to an extraterrestrial afterlife if they followed their leader Marshall Applewhite when their predictions failed when the spaceship never came did they question their beliefs number their faith became came stronger instead of seeing the failure as proof they were wrong they convinced themselves it was a test of loyalty and the more they sacrificed the harder it became to leave walking away would mean admitting their entire world view was a lie instead they doubled down until in 1997 their belief system led to a mass suicide but this isn't just about cults it happens everywhere the trick is escalation a manipul Ator starts small convincing you to accept a minor contradiction a little hypocrisy something that feels wrong but not wrong enough to walk away a toxic boss pushes an employee to cover for unethical Behavior just once it feels uncomfortable but they justify it I need this job then the requests get bigger before they realize it they're trapped in a system they would have once condemned the same happens in abusive relationships a partner starts with subtle manipulation small moments of confusion of twisting reality just enough to create doubt over time the victim has to rationalize the abuse they didn't mean it I must have done something to deserve it each justification locks them in deeper because if they admit the truth they'd have to face the fact that they stayed and it's not just individuals who fall for this trick entire societies do political and ideological groups use it constantly when people invest in a movement that later reveals itself to be corrupt or hypocritical they don't necessarily reject it instead they defend it they find ways to justify the contradictions because admitting they were fooled feels worse than continuing to believe a lie so how do you break free first recognize when your mind is fighting reality ask yourself am I defending this because I believe it or because I don't want to admit I was wrong second distance yourself emotional attachment clouds judgment step back and examine the facts without the weight of your own investment cognitive dissonance is a natural part of the human mind but when Amplified by manipulators it can turn even the most rational person into a prisoner of their own thoughts the scariest part the more you fight to convince your you're right the deeper you fall into the Trap the only way out stop fighting start questioning exploiting mirror neurons you yawn when someone else yawns you laugh when a room erupts in laughter your brain isn't just observing it's mirroring and while this Instinct fuels human connection it can also be turned against you in ways you'd never suspect at the core of this manipulation are mirror neurons specialized brain cells that fire not just when you act but when you see someone else acting these neurons are why you Flinch when someone gets hurt or instinctively smile when someone Smiles at you they're the foundation of empathy bonding and social influence but like any powerful tool they can be weaponized one of the most infamous examples the rise of Adolf Hitler Hitler didn't just give speeches he mirrored the emotions of his audience he reflected their fears frustrations and hopes back at them his speeches weren't just words they were emotional feedback loops Amplified by the crowd's response he didn't persuade with logic he made people feel and once emotion takes over critical thinking shuts down but mirroring doesn't need a massive crowd to work salespeople politicians cult leaders and con artists use it constantly a manipulator will subtly copy your posture tone and gestures to make you feel at ease your brain registers the similarity and assumes this person is like me I can trust them it's why a skilled con artist can make you spill your secrets within minutes of meeting them they're not just listening they're reflecting you back to yourself and this trick goes deeper mirroring can manufacture attraction and loyalty studies show that when someone subtly mimics your body language you're more like to like them trust them and agree with them even if you just met this is how toxic relationships begin an abuser may start by mirroring their victim's personality interests and values creating an illusion of perfect compatibility but once that bond is established the manipulation shifts the abuser no longer mirrors but controls knowing their victim is too emotionally invested to leave and this trick isn't just used by by individuals it's built into the systems we interact with every day social media algorithms act as digital mirror neurons ever notice how platforms feed you content that aligns with your existing beliefs that's not an accident the algorithm reflects back what you already think and feel strengthening your biases and filtering out anything that challenges them over time this creates Echo Chambers polarization and an inability to see other perspectives so how do you protect yourself first recognize when you're being mirrored if someone copies your mannerisms too closely or reflects your emotions too perfectly pause and question their intentions second disrupt the pattern change your posture shift topics or introduce an unexpected idea a genuine person will flow naturally with the conversation a manipulator will struggle they rely on predictability to maintain control mirror neurons make us human they help us connect learn and empathize but in the wrong hands they become a tool for manipulation turning your own instincts against you and the most terrifying part when done well you won't even realize it's happening exploiting empathy most people see empathy as a strength the foundation of trust connection and human kindness but in the wrong hands it's a weapon one that can be twisted exploited and used to control the most dangerous manipulators Don't force their victims into submission they make them feel like they're choosing it take munen syndrome by proxy a disturbing example of weaponized empathy a caregiver fabricates or induces illness in someone under their care often a child convincing them that they're sick the victim suffers real pain becomes completely dependent and never questions the person hurting them because they believe they're being helped meanwhile the abuser enjoys the sympathy attention and control that come from being seen as a devoted caretaker this is how manipulators trap people using their own compassion against them the trick is simple create a problem that makes someone feel responsible then present yourself as the only solution it starts with subtle guilt statements like your the only one who understands me if you leave I don't know what I'll do the goal make the target feel Irreplaceable while slowly eroding their autonomy and if someone resists that's where compassion fatigue comes in the manipulator increases their emotional demands overwhelming their victim until they break down from exhaustion at some point giving in feels easier than resisting and this technique is everywhere Cults convince followers to abandon their lives for a greater purpose framing doubt as selfishness toxic relationships trap one partner in Endless cycles of pity and guilt forcing them to stay scammers pose as victims sending desperate messages that make you feel like you're the only person who can help and the scariest part the more empathetic someone is the easier they are to manipulate because once you're compassion becomes an obligation you stop seeing the Trap and start justifying the chains obligation a small favor can feel harmless even thoughtful someone buys you lunch and the next time you feel an unspoken need to return the gesture a Friend helps you move and suddenly you hesitate when they ask for a favor even if it's inconvenient it's not forced it's not demanded but the weight of obligation lingers this Instinct the need to reciprocate kindness is natural it holds friendships together builds trust and keeps social exchanges fair but when used as a tool for control it becomes something else entirely in the 1970s members of the har Krishna movement stood in airports handing out flowers to strangers no catch no expectation just a gift but moments later they would ask for a donation and most people even those who didn't want the flower gave them money not because they had to but because they felt they should a simple Act of generosity became a carefully crafted trap bringing in millions of dollars from people who simply didn't want to seem ungrateful this is how the reciprocity principle works it doesn't demand it makes you feel like saying no is wrong it starts with small things a compliment a favor a helping hand until the sense of debt grows and when someone calls in that debt rejecting them feels like breaking an unspoken contract in personal relationships this kind of obligation can turn into quiet manipulation a partner showers you with gifts and attention then later reminds you how much they've done for you when they need something in return a friend who has always been generous suddenly makes you feel guilty for not being as available as they want the B bance shifts and what once felt like kindness becomes something you can't refuse this tactic extends Beyond personal interactions businesses give free samples because they know people are more likely to buy after receiving something at no cost Charities send small gifts in the mail before asking for donations making it harder to ignore the request scammers pretend to help before making their ask ensuring you feel obligated to return the favor and the weight of obligation isn't easy to shake it lingers making people stay in bad situations agree to things they wouldn't normally accept and hesitate when they should walk away recognizing this trick is the first step to avoiding it not every favor needs to be repaid not every act of kindness comes with strings if saying no makes you feel guilty ask yourself was this really a gift or was it a transaction disguised as one divide and conquer two people once Inseparable suddenly find themselves questioning everything about each other the trust they built over years starts to crack not because of anything they did but because someone else wanted it that way a rumor here a twisted truth there small calculated actions designed to drive a wedge between them and once that wedge is deep enough the person who planted it owns the game this is divide and conquer a manipulation strategy so effective that it has been used for centuries to control groups dismantle alliances and consolidate power it works by breaking apart Unity making sure people are too distracted by conflict to notice who's pulling the strings history is full of examples the British Empire used this strategy to control vast territories turning local groups against each other so they were too busy fighting among themselves to challenge colonial rule authoritarian leaders do the same stoking division among their people whether through political factions social groups or manufactured outrage to prevent anyone from uniting against them but this isn't just a strategy used on Grand scales it happens in everyday life a manipulative boss pits employees against each other ensuring no one trusts their co-workers enough to push back against unfair treatment a toxic partner creates tension between their significant other and their friends or family making sure they become the only trusted influence narcissists thrive on this trick subtly spreading misinformation to make sure no one around them forms a strong enough bond to resist their control the key is isolation when people no longer trust each other they become dependent on the manipulator they seek validation approval and direction from the only person who seems liable the one who caused the division in the first place that's when control is complete and the scariest part it doesn't take outright lies to work just a small Distortion of the truth a missing piece of context a carefully timed exaggeration the result allies turn into enemies and the one pulling the strings remains Untouchable Authority bias in 1961 an experiment took place that revealed something deeply unsettling about human nature psychologist Stanley Milgram wanted to understand how far people would go when following orders from an authority figure participants were led to believe they were part of a learning study their task to administer electric shocks to another person every time they answered a question incorrectly with each mistake the shocks grew stronger escalating from mild discomfort to agonizing pain the person being shocked screamed pleaded even fell silent but here's the catch they weren't real they were actors pretending to suffer yet most participants kept pressing the button they hesitated they looked uneasy but when the man in the white lab coat told them to continue they did two-thirds of them followed instructions to the very end delivering what they believed to be potentially fatal shocks simply because an authority figure told them to this is Authority bias our instinctive tendency to trust and Obey those we see as powerful knowledgeable or in charge it's the same psychological mechanism that makes us follow doctor's orders without question believe news anchors without verifying facts or obey workplace policies even when they don't make sense but in the wrong hands this Instinct can be exploited overriding morality logic and even self-preservation history is full of examples corrupt governments have used blind obedience to justify atrocities corporations have suppressed whistleblowers by enforcing rigid hierarchies cult leaders have demanded absolute loyalty convincing followers to surrender their freedom their money even their lives Authority bias works because the brain takes shortcuts instead of questioning every decision it assumes authority figures know best a uniform a title a badge these symbols create an illusion of infallibility and the more confident an authority figure appears the harder it becomes to challenge them this is why scammers pose as police officers to extort money why historical medical figures convince people to accept harmful treatments why soldiers in war zones have carried out Unthinkable orders because refusing wasn't an option and the effect becomes even stronger when a obedience is combined with fear when an authority figure not only commands but also threatens whether subtly or openly resistance becomes nearly impossible people comply even when they know something is wrong because defying Authority feels dangerous the most disturbing part you don't even need real authority to exploit this bias just the illusion of it a uniform a fake badge a confident tone these are often enough to make people comply without question the most effective tricks Don't force people into submission they make them willingly hand over control scapegoating history repeats itself not because people don't learn but because manipulation works and one of the oldest most dangerous psychological tricks is scapegoating the art of blaming a single person or group for problems they didn't create it's a tactic so powerful that it has fueled witch hunts toppled governments and destroyed countless lives a perfect example the Salem witch trials in the late 1600s paranoia gripped the Massachusetts Bay Colony strange illnesses crop failures Rising tensions people needed answers and instead of facing the complexities of reality they turned to a simple chilling conclusion witchcraft dozens of people mostly women were accused with little to no evidence Neighbors betrayed neighbors executions followed and yet the real problem the fear and instability Brewing beneath the surface remained untouched because scapegoating isn't about finding the truth it's about controlling the narrative so why does it work so well because people crave simple answers to complex problems when things go wrong whether in a family a workplace or an entire nation it's easier to believe there's a single villain behind it all admitting that problems are complicated that they might not have one neat explanation is uncomfortable blame brings relief it gives people the illusion of understanding even if that understanding is completely false and this trick isn't just used in history books blame shifting a smaller but equally dangerous version happens every day a cheating partner accuses their spouse of being paranoid a corrupt politician blames the media for their downfall a failing CEO pins the company's collapse on lazy employees it's a psychological slight of hand redirecting attention so the real problem stays hidden and the more this trick is used the harder it becomes to see the truth the scapegoat becomes the distraction the real causes of the problem remain untouched and people become so invested in their blame that they reject any evidence that contradicts it this is how entire groups have been persecuted throughout history not because of what they did but because someone needed a villain so how do you avoid falling into this trap look beyond the obvious if a problem is being reduced to a single enemy ask yourself who benefits from this what's being ignored while all attention is focused on the scapegoat and most importantly are you being manipulated into believing an easy lie over a difficult truth because the most effective form of control isn't Force it's fear and when that fear is given a face a name a scapegoat it becomes the perfect weapon social proof exploitation in 1968 a woman named Kitty genovesi was attacked outside her apartment in New York she screamed for help for nearly half an hour dozens of people saw or heard the assault yet no one intervened no one called the police everyone assumed someone else would step in this chilling effect is known as social proof a psychological bias so deeply ingrained that it influences almost every decision we make it's the instinct to follow the crowd to assume that if many people believe or do something it must be right it's why people flock to restaurants with long lines Why Trends take off overnight and why misinformation can spread faster than truth but when social proof is manipulated it becomes a weapon advertisers use it constantly they tell you millions of people love their product that it's a number one bestseller or that everyone is switching to a new service you might have never looked into it yourself but the illusion of mass approval makes you instinctively trust it even a handful of fake reviews can be enough to push someone toward a purchase scammers use the same trick ever seen a product flooded with glowing but susp suspiciously similar reviews a cryptocurrency hyped up by bots on social media a sudden surge of accounts promoting a false narrative these tactics manufacture credibility where none exists it's the same method used by Cults Pony schemes and propaganda machines make people believe everyone else is doing it and they'll follow but the real danger of social proof isn't just in marketing it's in how it controls behavior in groups studies show that the more people witness an emergency the less likely anyone is to help it's called the bystander effect everyone assumes someone else will take responsibility and in extreme cases social proof fuels mob mentality a person who would never commit violence alone might do so in a crowd because it feels Justified morality gets outsourced if no one else is stopping it it must be okay and here's where it gets unsettling it doesn't take much to trigger social proof a few planted opinions a handful of fake followers a carefully orchestrated Trend and suddenly the illusion becomes real once enough people believe something even Skeptics start to fall in line the scariest part most people will never realize they've been manipulated they'll follow the crowd convinced they made the decision themselves group think induction one of the most dangerous psychological tricks isn't about manipulating a single person it's about influencing entire groups until questioning the consensus feels impossible it doesn't force people to agree instead it creates an environment where disagreement feels like betrayal and once that happens people stop thinking critically even when the decisions being made are obviously flawed imagine a high stakes corporate meeting a company is about to launch a product and everything points a disaster market research shows customers won't buy it Engineers warn about technical failures and some Executives have private doubts but in the room there's nothing but agreement no one speaks up no one challenges the decision not because they don't see the problem but because no one wants to be the outlier this is group think a psychological phenomenon where the need for Unity overrides logic skepticism and even self-preservation when people are part of a group they instinctively prioritize Harmony dissent feels uncomfortable doubt makes you an outsider and when the loudest most dominant voices set the tone everyone else follows often without realizing it it happens gradually maybe an authority figure expresses a strong opinion and others instinctively align with it maybe the group values agreement so much that disagreeing feels like an attack over time the pressure to conform becomes stronger than the pressure to be right people suppress their doubts rationalize bad ideas and convince themselves that if everyone else agrees it must be the right decision and the consequences disastrous history is full of catastrophic decisions fueled by group think failed military invasions Financial collapses political disasters moments where in hindsight the flaws were obvious but no one spoke up when it mattered and the most dangerous part inside the group think bubble people don't feel manipulated they believe they're thinking for themselves but in reality they're just echoing the voices around them cultivating a false identity some manipulators don't just lie they become the LIE they shape their identities to fit whatever will make people trust them molding themselves into whoever they need to be this isn't just deception its performance and when done well it's nearly impossible to detect Frank abigil the real life con artist behind Catch Me If You Can pulled off one of the most audacious identity scams in history before the age of 21 he had successfully posed as a pilot a doctor and a lawyer bluffing his way into positions of authority with nothing but charm confidence and carefully chosen details his entire person was an illusion but it worked because he understood a fundamental truth people don't question what looks real enough we instinctively judge others based on surface level cues someone who acts like they belong who speaks with conviction who looks the part our brains fill in the gaps assuming they must be who they claim to be a skilled manipulator doesn't just tell lies they create a version of themselves that people want to believe and once they establish a false identity something strange happens the illusion feeds itself others begin reinforcing it vouching for the manipulator defending them even ignoring red flags if enough people believe the lie it becomes reality cult leaders convince their followers of divine wisdom scammers build reputations that seem Untouchable even entire societies have been swayed by figures who were never who they claim to be a false identity doesn't just fool others it can warp the manipulator's own sense of reality when someone fully Embraces their fabricated Persona the line between deception and Truth disappears for them and for everyone around them and once that happens even they may no longer know what's real the seeds of self-doubt you don't need chains to keep someone trapped sometimes all it takes is a whisper in their mind one that makes them question everything they once knew about themselves the most Insidious form of control doesn't come from force or coercion it comes from planting a simple thought what if I'm not good enough this is the art of sowing self-doubt a psychological trick that can dismantle confidence reshape reality and keep someone locked in a cycle of second guessing themselves and the worst part once the seed is plant Ed most people water it themselves a classic example the infamous mgrm experiment while it's often remembered for obedience to Authority there's something more subtle at play participants weren't just pressured into shocking others they were gradually led to doubt their own moral instincts at first they resisted but after being repeatedly told it's fine keep going you have to do this began to question their own judgment if they hesitated the authority figure reassured them and with each step forward their resistance weakened by the end they weren't just following orders they had convinced themselves that their hesitation was misplaced that maybe they were overreacting that's how self-doubt works it doesn't strike all at once it seeps in slowly often through calculated strategic manipulation it can start with a simple comment are you sure that's the right choice that doesn't sound like you you always mess things up like this when repeated enough it forces the brain to spiral it makes people look for evidence that maybe just maybe those doubts are true and once someone starts believing it their confidence collapses like a house of cards skilled manipulators use this to control others without Ever Lifting a finger if you make someone doubt themselves enough they'll look to you for validation they'll become dependent on your approval constantly seeking reassurance that they're making the right choices over time they lose trust in their own judgment and start deferring to the person who knows better this is how toxic relationships Thrive it's how abusers keep their victims trapped it's how cult leaders maintain absolute Authority but here's the most terrifying part self-doubt once ingrained doesn't just go away even if the manipulator disappears the seeds they planted continue to grow the voice of Doubt remains Whispering maybe they were right about me and that's why this trick is so dangerous it doesn't just break people it makes them break themselves emotional contagion exploitation have you ever walked into a room and immediately felt the energy shift maybe a single glance at someone's expression made you tense up or a friend's excitement instantly lifted your mood this isn't just intuition it's a psychological phenomenon known as emotional contagion and in the wrong hands it's one of the most dangerous manipulation tactics ever used emotional contagion is the subconscious transfer of emotions from one person to another humans are wired to mirror emotions it's part of how we connect empathize and communicate if someone around you is anxious your brain picks up on their cues body language tone facial expressions and before you know it you start feeling anxious too this happens automatically without conscious awareness and that's exactly what makes it so easy to exploit a terrifying example of this in action Mass hysteria take the Salem Witch Trials one person shows fear another reacts and soon an entire town is swept up in paranoia nobody questions the source they just react to the the emotional waves spreading around them the same effect plays out in financial crashes riots and even cult Dynamics when people around you panic you feel the urgency too even if there's no logical reason for it manipulators use emotional contagion to control people without ever needing to say do this instead they create an emotional atmosphere that makes people want to comply a leader radiating confidence can make their followers ignore obvious flaws a narcissist feigning sadness can guiltrip someone into staying in a toxic relationship a salesperson hyping up a product can make you feel like you need to buy it simply because their enthusiasm is infectious studies show that even faked emotions can trigger genuine responses a manipulator can manufacture anger fear or excitement and the people around them will absorb and reflect those feelings without realizing they're being played and once you're emotionally hooked your ability to think critically starts to fade it's why political figures rally crowds into a frenzy why cult leaders maintain unwavering Authority and why toxic relationships often feel impossible to leave when someone controls the emotional climate they control the people within it the next time you feel an emotion Rising that wasn't there before stop and ask is this mine or was it planted there because not every feeling you experience is truly your own the illusion of choice you think you're in control you think every decision you make is entirely your own but what if I told you that more often than not your choices are being carefully orchestrated designed to make you feel like you're in charge when in reality you're just following a predetermined path this is the illusion of choice one of the most deceptive and manipulative psychological iCal tricks ever used think about a restaurant menu you sit down glance at the options and decide between the stake the pasta or the salad but did you ever question why those specific options are there in the first place why is there no burger no sushi the truth is your decision was already limited before you even had a chance to think about it this trick is everywhere from politics to marketing to Everyday interactions and it works because people don't usually question the choices they're given one of the most famous real world examples supermarkets you walk in planning to grab a loaf of bread and before you know it you're walking out with three extra things you never planned on buying how store layouts are deliberately designed to guide your movements steering you toward impulse purchases while making you believe you're shopping freely but the illusion of choice doesn't just exist in retail it shapes our opinion beliefs and even our behaviors ever noticed how political debates always boil down to two opposing sides you're told you must pick one or the other when in reality the framework of the argument was already set before you got involved by limiting the choices the person in control ensures that no matter which option you pick the outcomes still serves their agenda marketers use this trick constantly a company might offer for three pricing tiers for a product one cheap one expensive and one just right in the middle most people choose the middle option thinking they've made a rational decision but that middle price point was strategically placed to push you toward it you were never really choosing freely you were being nudged in a specific Direction this concept is even more Sinister when it's used in personal relationships ever had someone say you can either do this my way or we can end things that's not a real Choice that's control disguised as compromise it forces you to accept a limited set of options making you feel like you had agency when in reality you were trapped from the start the illusion of choice thrives on the assumption that having some options equals true freedom but real Freedom isn't just picking from a list it's questioning who made the list in the first place the scariest part the best manipulators don't need to take away your choices they just need to make you believe you had control all along anchoring bias exploitation how much would you pay for a cup of coffee $10 5 1 whatever number popped into your head first chances are it wasn't completely random it was anchored to something maybe the price of coffee at your favorite Cafe maybe a ridiculous $10 figure I just mentioned but what if I told you that your perception of value fairness and even reality itself can be hijacked by a simple trick known as anchoring bias and the worst part you'd never even notice it happening let's look at a classic example imagine you walk into a store and you see a high-end watch marked at $10,000 that's absurdly expensive right but right next to it there's another watch for $2,000 suddenly it doesn't seem so bad why because your brain just got anchored to the first higher price even if you weren't planning to buy anything the comparison makes the second option feel reasonable when in reality it's still overpriced this trick isn't just used in sales it's everywhere ever noticed how restaurants have one or two ridiculously expensive dishes on the menu those aren't meant to be best sellers they exist solely to make everything else seem affordable marketers salespeople even politicians all use anchoring to subtly control how perceive information but it gets even darker anchoring isn't just about money it can manipulate beliefs emotions and decisions imagine you're negotiating for a job salary the company starts by suggesting a figure that's far below what you expected you push back and they generously raise the offer a little now instead of negotiating based on what you deserve you're negotiating based on the lowball number they planted in your head and here's where it gets really disturbing anchoring is often used to distort reality itself let's say a news report tells you that crime in your city has increased by 300% but they don't tell you what the Baseline was maybe there was only one case last year and now there are four but by anchoring you to that big percentage they make the change seem terrifying your perception of safety of urgency even of what needs to be done all of it shifts just because of a single carefully placed number now think about personal relationships have you ever been in a conversation where someone subtly set a standard maybe about what's normal in a relationship how much effort someone should put in or what's considered too sensitive to be upset about that's anchoring too a manipulator might start with an extreme statement like you're overreacting this is completely fine mind even if you push back your mind starts adjusting to that as the Baseline over time what once felt unacceptable becomes The New Normal the terrifying truth anchoring bias works because our brains crave reference points we don't judge things in isolation We compare them to the first number idea or emotion we encounter and once that anchor is set Breaking Free from it is almost impossible the best manipulators don't need to control all your choices just the first one because once that anchor is in place the rest of your decisions will fall exactly where they want them to framing affects manipulation let's say you walk into a store and see a sign that says 90% fat-free yogurt sounds pretty healthy right but right next to it another brand says contains 10% fat suddenly that second one doesn't seem so great even though it's literally the same thing this is the framing effect a psychological trick that doesn't change the facts just how they're presented and believe it or not this simple shift in wording is enough to alter your entire decision-making process now you might be thinking okay so what that's just marketing but framing is far more dangerous than making you pick a certain yogurt it's used to shape political opinions control public perception and even manipulate your emotions Without You realizing it here's a classic example imagine a new policy is proposed to combat a deadly disease if people are told this policy will save 200 lives they're much more likely to support it than if they're told this policy will let 400 people die even though both statements are mathematically identical one just highlights saving lives while the other highlights losing them but framing doesn't just work with numbers numbers it works with morality let's take a controversial issue call one group pro-life and the other pro-choice notice how both sides are framed in a way that makes them sound positive no one wants to be called anti-life or anti-choice the way something is framed can instantly make it feel right or wrong even before you hear the details and that's where it gets really dangerous framing can be used to control narratives in way ways that shape reality itself imagine two headlines about the same event protesters demand Justice in the streets rioting mobs wreak havoc in the city same situation completely different emotional reaction if you read one you'll sympathize with the cause if you read the other you'll fear the chaos and yet both could be describing the exact same group of people this is how media governments and even corporations push agendas without ever needing to lie they don't have to change the truth they just have to present it in a way that makes you feel a certain way once they control the frame they control your reaction and it gets even darker in personal relationships ever had someone Apologize by saying I'm sorry you feel that way instead of I'm sorry for what I did that's framing it subtly shifts the the blame onto you for reacting rather than them for doing something wrong or imagine a toxic partner saying I'm just trying to help instead of I'm trying to control you the same action but one frame makes them the Savior the other makes them the villain once a frame is set it's almost impossible to break out of if you're introduced to a person as trouble every action they take will be seen through that lens if a company convinces you their product is a luxury item you'll justify paying more even if the quality is the same as a cheaper alternative framing doesn't manipulate facts it manipulates perspective and when someone controls the way you see the world they don't need to force you to act a certain way you'll do it willingly confirmation bias reinforcement imagine two people watching the same news story One Believes the government is corrupt the other thinks it's doing a great job they both walk away from the broadcast feeling more convinced than ever that they're right how because they only paid attention to the parts that supported what they already believed that's confirmation bias the brain's built-in filter that makes us see only what we want to see while ignoring everything else and here's the dark part once someone understands how this works they can use it to trap you inside your own beliefs one of the most infamous examples Cults they don't try to convince new recruits that everything they say is true instead they just subtly reinforce ideas that recruits already suspect if someone is disillusioned with Society the cult doesn't argue with them it amplifies that frustration feeding them only the information that makes them angrier at the outside world eventually they stop questioning and only accept ideas that confirm what the cult wants them to believe the same principle is used in politics ever wonder why people get sucked into Echo Chambers it's because reinforcing confirmation bias is more powerful than changing someone's mind social media algorithms are built on this if you click on an article that aligns with your opinion your feed floods with more of the same reinforcing your views over and over over time it creates the illusion that everyone agrees with you because anything that contradicts your beliefs is filtered out before you even see it and it doesn't stop at politics or Cults it's everywhere think about conspiracy theories once someone believes the Earth is flat any evidence proving them wrong is dismissed as a coverup the more you try to argue the deeper they dig into their belief because their brain is actively rejecting anything that challenges it marketers and scammers know how to exploit this too they don't sell you a product by convincing you it works instead they find people who already suspect it works and give them proof that confirms their suspicions testimonials selective data and emotionally charged language make sure you focus on only the positive results ignoring anything that contradicts them even in everyday relationships this trick is used to manipulate people a toxic partner doesn't try to convince you that they're perfect instead they feed into your existing fears whether it's self-doubt abandonment issues or insecurity they make sure that any situation can be twisted to confirm what you already fear see everyone leaves you in the end over time this erodes your ability to see reality clearly because your brain starts filtering out anything that contradicts those fears confirmation bias doesn't just make us ignore the truth it makes us actively fight against it once you're caught in its grip even undeniable facts feel like an attack people don't just hold on to false beliefs they defend them because admitting they're wrong feels like a personal threat that's why the most effective manipulators don't try to argue with you they don't present new evidence or force you to believe something different they simply control the flow of information making sure that everything you see and hear confirms what they want you to believe and one once that happens they don't need to change your mind you'll do that yourself the B mhof phenomenon you ever notice that the moment you learn about something it suddenly starts appearing everywhere you hear a weird phrase for the first time and now it's in every conversation you see a rare car on the street and now it's parked on every corner it's not magic it's not a conspiracy it's a psychological trick your own brain plays on you and it can be weaponized against you this is called the B mhof phenomenon also known as frequency illusion once your brain latches onto a concept it starts filtering the world differently the information was always there but your mind is now tuned to recognize it and that makes it feel like reality itself is changing here's where it gets dark this psychological Quirk can be exploited to manipulate what you believe how you think and even how you behave Without You realizing it let's say someone wants to control a narrative they introduce an idea subtly maybe you see a tweet overhear a conversation or watch a video casually mentioning it at first it means nothing but then you start noticing it everywhere it's in news headlines social media feeds casual discussions and suddenly it feels like a universal truth but it's not not it's just your brain being hacked marketers use this to sell products a brand makes sure you randomly encounter their name multiple times a day making it feel more popular than it actually is politicians use it to push ideologies one repeated phrase one carefully planted idea and suddenly it feels like the whole world believes it cult leaders they plant a concept in your mind reinforce it subtly and soon it's impossible to ignore the B mhof phenomenon makes it alarmingly easy to distort reality and the worst part it doesn't even feel like manipulation it feels natural your brain convinces you that you discovered this pattern on your own that the world is confirming it for you that's what makes it so dangerous so the next time something suddenly seems to be everywhere pause ask yourself is this really happening or is someone somewhere making sure I see it exploiting mirror neurons you yawn when someone else yawns you laugh when a room erupts in laughter your brain isn't just observing it's mirroring and while this Instinct fuels human connection it can also be turned against you in ways you'd never suspect at the core of this manipulation are mirror neurons specialized brain cells that fire not just when you act but when you see someone else acting these neurons are why you Flinch when someone gets hurt or instinctively smile when someone Smiles at you they're the foundation of empathy bonding and social influence but like any powerful tool they can be weaponized one of the most infamous examples the rise of Adolf Hitler Hitler didn't just give speeches he mirrored the emotions of his audience he reflected their fears frustrations and hopes back at them his speeches weren't just words they were emotional feedback loops Amplified by the crowd's response he didn't persuade with logic he made people feel and once emotion takes over critical thinking shuts down but mirroring doesn't need a massive crowd to work salespeople politicians cult leaders and con artists use it constantly a manipulator will subtly copy your posture tone and gestures to make you feel at ease your brain registers the similarity and assumes this person is like me I can trust them it's why a skilled con artist can make you spill your secrets within minutes of meeting them they're not just listening they're reflecting you back to yourself and this trick goes deeper mirroring can manufacture attraction and loyalty studies show that when someone subtly mimics your body language you're more likely to like them trust them and agree agree with them even if you just met this is how toxic relationships begin an abuser may start by mirroring their victim's personality interests and values creating an illusion of perfect compatibility but once that bond is established the manipulation shifts the abuser no longer mirrors but controls knowing their victim is too emotionally invested to leave and this trick isn't just used by individuals it's built into the system systems we interact with every day social media algorithms act as digital mirror neurons ever notice how platforms feed you content that aligns with your existing beliefs that's not an accident the algorithm reflects back what you already think and feel strengthening your biases and filtering out anything that challenges them over time this creates Echo Chambers polarization and an inability to see other perspectives so how do you protect yourself first recognize when you're being mirrored if someone copies your mannerisms too closely or reflects your emotions too perfectly pause and question their intentions second disrupt the pattern change your posture shift topics or introduce an unexpected idea a genuine person will flow naturally with the conversation a manipulator will struggle they rely on predictability to maintain control mirror neurons make us human they help us connect learn and empathize but in the wrong hands they become a tool for manipulation turning your own instincts against you and the most terrifying part when done well you won't even realize it's happening pacing and leading you ever meet someone who just gets you someone who seems to be on your wavelength saying the right things making you feel like they understand you better than most you trust them maybe even follow their advice because well it feels natural but what if that was engineered what if they weren't just understanding you but leading you without you even realizing it this is called pacing and leading a psychological technique used in Persuasion manipulation and even mind control it works by first matching the person's thoughts emotions or behaviors pacing them before subtly shifting them toward a desire outcome done correctly it makes people agree comply or follow without resistance ever noticed how cult leaders con artists or even politicians start by mirroring the frustrations of Their audience I know how you feel you're tired you've been ignored you've been mistreated that's pacing acknowledging and aligning with the target's current reality and once trust is established they begin to lead and that's why you need to listen to me I have the solution follow me it's used in everyday life too salespeople Pace by repeating your concerns before guiding you toward a purchase interrogators gain compliance by mirroring body language speech and emotional state before steering responses even in relationships someone might first agree with your feelings making you feel safe before shaping your choices and here's what makes it dangerous it feels natural the manipulation isn't forced it's welcomed you think you're making decisions but in reality your choices have been prescripted introduced so smoothly that by the time you realize what's happening you're already two steps ahead on a path you never chose neurolinguistic programming ever had a conversation where someone seemed to be guiding your thoughts without you even realizing it where before you knew it you were agreeing nodding along and feeling strangely compelled to trust their perspective that wasn't an accident that was a technique neurolinguistic programming or NLP a set of psychological tricks so subtle so effective that entire Industries have been built on them at its core NLP is about influencing people's thoughts emotions and behaviors through language and subconscious cues it works by detecting patterns in speech body language and mental associations then subtly steering them toward a desired conclusion used ethically it's marketed as a way to improve communication confidence and persuasion used maliciously it can be a tool for manipulation deception and even control one of the most well-known examples the embedded command a hypnotic technique where a request is disguised within a casual sentence instead of directly telling someone you should trust me an NLP practitioner might say you might not even realize it yet but you're starting to trust what I'm saying the suggestion is planted the Mind processes it without resistance another tactic mirroring when someone subtly mimics your posture speech patterns and energy level your brain interprets it as familiarity you instinctively trust them without even knowing why cult leaders use it to build deep Rapport High Press salespeople use it to lower your defenses it's why you sometimes feel connected to someone you've only just met but the most chilling NLP trick is anchoring associating an emotion with a specific word gesture or stimulus if a manipulator repeatedly makes you feel safe whenever they use a certain phrase your brain links that feeling to them later even when they're being deceptive that same phrase triggers trust the real danger of NLP isn't just that it works it's that you won't even know it's happening subliminal messaging you think you're in control of your thoughts your choices your beliefs but what if I told you that right now as you listen to this there are messages being planted in your mind messages you'll never consciously register but will still influence your decisions subliminal messaging isn't Science Fiction it's real it's powerful and it's been used for decades to manipulate people without them ever realizing it the most infamous example the 1957 Coca-Cola experiment a market researcher named James vicory claimed he had flashed the words drink Coca-Cola and eat popcorn on a movie screen for just a fraction of a second too fast for conscious awareness but just enough for the subconscious to absorb it he later reported that concession sales skyrocketed the world panicked people feared they were being hypnotized into buying things against their will while vicory later admitted to falsifying the results the concept itself wasn't a lie in fact advertising agencies political campaigns and even intelligence agencies have since experimented with subliminal techniques because they work at its core subliminal messaging is about bypassing critical thinking the conscious mind filters information but the subconscious mind absorbs everything when an image phrase or idea is subtly repeated it embeds itself into your mind without resistance later when you're making a decision you'll feel a strange unexplained pull toward a certain choice because it has been implanted in your thoughts one way this is used hidden imagery and advertisements fast food brands have been caught placing visual triggers suggestive shapes familiar symbols even hidden words to make their food look more appealing political campaigns use color psychology and background music to create emotions that subtly sway opinions even social media algorithms play a role nudging people towards certain viewpoints by subtly reinforcing what they want you to see but it gets worse subliminal messaging isn't just visual it's auditory too certain sounds embedded at barely perceptible levels in music or commercials can trigger specific emotional responses some studies suggest that low frequency sounds can induce unease while higher frequencies can create a sense of urgency or excitement have you ever walked into a store and suddenly felt compelled to shop longer that could be carefully designed background music manipulating your brain into staying browsing and buying and then there's priming you see something subtle an image a phrase a color without realizing its impact later when you encounter a related situation your brain fills in the gaps and nudges you toward the outcome it's been preconditioned to expect casinos do this all the time bright flashing lights the constant sound of slot machines winning no clocks no windows it's all engineered to make you lose track of time and keep spending perhaps the darkest part of fimal messaging is how seamlessly it integrates into everyday life news outlets use subtle word choices to shape narratives social media platforms carefully curate your feed to reinforce your beliefs even in relationships people can use subliminal reinforcement to manipulate their Partners gradually altering their perception of reality so the question is how much of your thinking is actually yours how many choices have you made that were subtle engineered without you even realizing it the most unsettling part about subliminal messaging isn't that it exists it's that you may never truly know when it's working on you priming effects you walk into a store and soft classical music is playing you feel a little more refined maybe a bit more willing to splurge later you're at a restaurant and the menu has elegant cursive font suddenly the higher pric dishes seem more appealing you think you're making decisions freely but in reality you've been primed priming is one of the most subtle yet powerful psychological tricks it's the process of implanting an idea into your mind without you realizing it making you more likely to think feel or act in a certain way it doesn't require Force persuasion or even awareness it's a whisper to your subconscious guiding your decisions before you even know you're making them one of the most famous examples of priming action the old age experiment researchers had participants unscramble sentences containing words like wrinkled Bingo and Florida afterward they timed how long it took them to walk down a hallway the result those exposed to age related words walked significantly slower without realizing why their minds had been primed to feel older and their bodies responded accordingly this trick is everywhere supermarkets Place fresh flowers near the entrance to make you associate the store with freshness and quality political ads repeat the same phrases over and over until they become familiar and therefore more believable job interviewers are influenced by words they saw earlier in the day if they read about failure they might judge a candidate more harshly priming works because the brain loves patterns it's constantly looking for connections even when none exist exist if you hear the word yellow you'll recognize banana faster than if you heard an unrelated word if you see a brand logo frequently enough you start to feel like you trust it even if you've never bought their product but here's where it gets darker priming isn't just about nudging choices it can be used to control narratives and perceptions news headlines carefully choose words to set the tone of a story before you even read the details a crime report using you instead of gang makes the event feel different a company calling layoffs right sizing makes job losses sound like a strategic move rather than a failure and it gets worse in legal cases a single priming word can sway a jury when Witnesses are asked how fast was the car going when it smashed into the other they estimate higher speeds than if asked how fast was it going when it bumped into the other one word smashed was is enough to distort their memory social media feeds priming effects constantly every like every suggested post every trending topic it's all shaping how you think before you even form your own opinion even a simple change in font or color can influence emotions studies show that people primed with the color red tend to perform worse on tests likely because red is unconsciously linked to danger and correction the most dangerous part once Prime primed you rarely question it if you're primed to see someone as untrustworthy you'll interpret everything they do through that lens if you're primed to expect a bad experience you'll find reasons to confirm it priming doesn't just influence one moment it reshapes how you filter reality so ask yourself how many of your thoughts are truly yours and more importantly how many of them were planted before you even realized it suggestive language and hypnosis have you ever been in a conversation where someone subtly LED you to a decision one you thought was entirely your own maybe you walked into a store and before you knew it you were convinced to buy something you didn't even need you probably thought it was your own choice but what if it wasn't what if a few carefully chosen words could bypass your critical thinking and plant a decision in your mind before you even realize it that's the power of suggestive language and hypnosis a method so subtle yet so effective that it has been used to influence everything from courtroom testimonies to political speeches it's not about swinging pocket watches or making people cluck like chickens it's about shaping perception without resistance take the infamous 1970s case of the Lost in the mall experiment a psychologist named Elizabeth Loftus wanted to test how easily people's memories could be manipulated she told participants a fake childhood story about being lost in a shopping mall crying and finally being rescued by a kind stranger the catch this never actually happened yet many participants remembered the event in Vivid detail their minds filled in the gaps creating a false reality just because someone suggested it that's the terrifying part of suggestive language it doesn't need to be true to be effective it just needs to be framed in a way that your brain accepts it as truth now combine this with hypnosis and you have something even more unsettling hypnosis isn't about mind control it's about lowering psychological defenses it puts a person in a state of hyperfocus and relaxation where suggestions slip in without triggering resistance in this state someone can be guided to believe feel or even remember things that never actually happened it works through embedded commands phrases hidden within normal conversation a politician might say when you step into that voting booth you'll feel a strong sense of trust in our leadership the key phrase feel a strong sense of trust it's not an argument it's a suggestion one your brain processes without questioning marketing and sales use this constantly a waiter asking would you like the steak or the seafood special is subtly removing your ability to say no the question assumes you're ordering it's just a matter of what and then there's the yes ladder technique small agreements Prime people for larger ones a classic car salesman trick start with minor commitments this is a nice car isn't it wouldn't it be great to drive something that's reliable you'd probably love how smooth the handling feels right each small yes makes the next one feel natural by the time the contract is in front of you your brain is wired to agree but here's where it gets even darker suggestive language can be used to alter memories behaviors and even identities cult leaders con artists and even interrogators use these techniques to shape narratives frame a question the right way and you can change someone's reality police interrogations have led to false confessions using suggestive language a suspect repeatedly told you don't remember it now but memory comes back in pieces may start doubting their own innocence their mind tries to reconcile the contradiction eventually it's easier to just believe they did it and once a suggestion takes hold it's nearly impossible to undo that's the true horror of it a single phrase a carefully worded statement a slight shift in tone it can rewrite someone's perception of reality forever so how many of your beliefs are actually yours and how many were planted there without you ever realizing it creating a sense of urgency imagine this you're scrolling through an online store when you see the perfect item but then a bold red timer appears beneath it only two left in stock sale ends in 3 minutes your heart rate spikes you don't have time to think if you hesitate you might lose it forever so you buy it and just like that you've been played this is the power of urgency manipulation one of the most effective ways to control human behavior it bypasses rational thinking and forces people to act on impulse the worst part you probably won't even realize you've been manipulated a perfect real world example the 1938 War of the world's radio broadcast when auson Wells performed a fictional Alien Invasion as a news style broadcast thousands of people panicked why because it felt immediate they didn't have time to think critically reports of alien attacks spread before anyone even questioned if it was real that's what urgency does it hijacks your brain and forces immediate action so how does this psychological trick work it plays on loss aversion a bias where people fear losing something more than they desire gaining it the idea that an opportunity is slipping away triggers anxiety which clouds judgment marketers use it constantly limited time offer flash sale only a few left in stock these phrases aren't just information they're psychological weapons suddenly buying isn't a choice it's a race and the moment you feel rushed you've already lost but it gets even darker Cults scammers and con artists rely on urgency to trap victims before they can think clearly pyramid schemes for example push recruits into making Fast Financial commitments act now or you'll miss your chance to be rich the pressure forces decisions without scrutiny by the time the person realizes they're already In Too Deep even politicians and media Outlets weaponize urgency fear-mongering headlines emergency press conferences breaking news alerts all designed to provoke immediate emotional reactions when people are afraid they don't stop to verify facts that's when misinformation spreads the fastest think about how Wars start how stock markets crash how riots explode overnight it's almost always a manufactured sense of urgency when emotions take control rational thought shuts down and that's the moment people become the easiest to manipulate the most disturbing part urgency feels natural it feels like you're making the right decision when in reality someone else has already made it for you so the next time you see a countdown timer an urgent warning or someone pushing you to act immediately pause because the moment you feel rushed you might already be under someone else's control foot in the door technique let's start with a simple question would you put a tiny sticker on your window to support a cause you believe in seems harmless right it's just a sticker but what if a few weeks later the same organization asked you to put up a full-size sign in your front yard statistically you're far more likely to say yes simply because you said yes to the first much smaller request and just like that you've fallen into one of the most Insidious psychological traps the foot in the door technique this trick is terrifyingly effective because it doesn't feel like manipulation it feels like your own decision one of the most famous real world examples the 1974 Patty Hurst case Patty the ays to a newspaper Empire was kidnapped by the Symbian Liberation Army a radical militant group initially she was terrified but her captors didn't force her to pledge loyalty overnight they started small forcing her to record a message condemning her family then she participated in minor activities and before long she was robbing banks alongside her captors fully believing in their cause how does this work the trick exploits consistency bias our deep psychological need to stay consistent with our past Behavior if we agree to a small request we subconsciously align ourselves with that choice when a bigger request follows our brain justifies compliance by thinking I already said said yes once so this must be the right thing to do advertisers use this constantly ever wondered why free trials exist once you've used a service for a few weeks you feel committed the thought of cancelling even if you don't really need it feels like going back on your own decision it's also a weapon in High Press sales first they convince you to just take a test drive then just sit down and talk numbers before you know it you're signing ERS trapped by the momentum of your own compliance and in Darker cases this is how Cults and extremist groups recruit they don't ask for absolute loyalty upfront instead they start with something small attend a meeting sign a petition donate a small amount the deeper you go the harder it becomes to say no because once you take that first step you're already walking down the path they chose for you think think about this the next time someone asks for a small favor the request itself might not be the real trap it's what comes after that you should be worried about door in the face technique let's say a charity worker approaches you on the street and asks would you be willing to donate $500 to help struggling families that's a big ask you probably hesitate feel a little awkward and then say no but then they follow up with okay totally understandable how about just $20 that second request suddenly feels so much smaller more reasonable and without realizing it you reach into your pocket and hand over the cash you just fell for one of the most powerful compliance techniques in Psychology the door in the face technique this trick works because of something deeply embedded in human psychology reciprocal concessions when someone lowers their demand after an initial rejection we feel pressured to meet them halfway it's as if we now owe them something just because they made a compromise it's been tested in countless studies in one famous experiment researchers first asked students to commit to volunteering 2 hours a week for 2 years at a juvenile detention center every single person declined but then they immediately followed up with a much smaller request okay would you at least be willing to Chaperone a group of kids on a one-day trip to the zoo three times as many students agreed to the second request compared to when it was asked outright why because after saying no to the extreme request the smaller one felt like an easy favor in comparison and this technique is everywhere think about negotiations A salesperson might start with an outrageous price only to generously bring it down to a number they wanted all along making you feel like you scored a deal it's also a favorite tactic in law enforcement and interrogation techniques a detective might push a Suspect with an extreme accusation maybe even falsely implying a life- ruining punishment only to then offer a much lesser charge if they confess faced with the horrifying First Option the second one feels like an escape but in reality it's a trap on a darker scale this is how manipulative people and organizations operate Cults High control groups and even abusive relationships exploit this principle to break people down first they demand absolute obedience or extreme sacrifice something impossible but when they relent and ask for just a little loyalty just a small compromise it suddenly feels manageable and just like that you're in because the real trick isn't about getting what they ask for it's about making you feel like saying yes was your idea lowballing you walk into a car dealership excit exed to buy your first car the salesperson greets you with a warm smile and says good news we have a special deal today this car fully loaded for just $20,000 that's within your budget you shake hands feel the thrill of the purchase and start picturing yourself behind the wheel but just as you're about to sign the paperwork the salesperson frowns and says I just checked with my manager unfortunately I made a mistake that price doesn't include some mandatory fees it's actually $23,000 at this point you're already mentally committed to the car you've imagined owning it maybe even bragged to friends about the deal you got so instead of walking away you agree to the new price you just got low bowled this psychological trick is devastatingly effective it works by getting you to commit to something before the full cost is revealed once you've made a decision even based on misleading information you become emotionally and mentally invested backing out now feels like a loss even though the terms have changed one of the most famous studies on lowballing involved college students psychologists asked them to participate in a study most agreed but after they committed they were informed the study required them to show up at 7:00 a.m. even though that's an inconvenient time most stuck with their original decision instead of backing out this tactic isn't just for sales it's used in jobs negotiations and even relationships a recruiter might promise a dream job with a high salary only for the offer to suddenly include longer hours lower pay or extra responsibilities in more manipulative scenarios low balling is used to control people a cult or extremist group might invite someone in with seemingly harmless requests attend a seminar listen to a speech meet some people but after committing they're slowly asked for more and more by the time they realize how deep they're in they've already accepted so many conditions that turning back feels impossible because the real danger of lowballing it's not just about losing money it's about losing control bandwagon effect manipulation it starts with a simple thought everyone else is doing it so it must be right that's the bandwagon effect in action the psychologic trick that exploits your deepest most primitive fear the fear of being left out it's what makes people follow Trends believe in misinformation and conform to ideas they've never even questioned think about the Salem witch trials in the late 1600s a few accusations of Witchcraft spiraled into Mass hysteria leading to dozens of executions why because people saw their neighbors turning on each other and instead of questioning the madness they joined in when the crowd Moves In One Direction standing against it feels impossible at its core the bandwagon effect is simple when enough people adopt a belief or behavior others follow not because they logically agree but because they fear being left behind it's why Financial bubbles form think of the 2008 housing crisis people kept investing in real estate watching price climb higher and higher everyone else was doing it so it must have been safe right until the bubble popped and the economy collapsed it's why propaganda works when a government wants to push an idea they don't need to convince everyone they just need enough people to believe it once the illusion of consensus is created the rest follow and here's where it gets dark the bandwagon effect is actively weaponized advertisers use it to manipulate consumer Behavior making people feel that if they don't buy a product they're missing out social media algorithms exploit it amplifying content that already has engagement because if thousands of people like a post others are more likely to believe it even if it's false politicians manufacture public approval by staging rallies with paid crowds creating the illusion of widespread support it bypasses critical thinking people stop question questioning whether something is Right logical or even true they just go along with it the more people follow the stronger the effect becomes snowballing into Mass Conformity and once you're on the bandwagon you don't even realize it you become convinced it was your choice all along creating a sense of scarcity ever noticed how the moment something seems limited exclusive or hard to get you suddenly want it more it doesn't matter whether it's a luxury car a rare sneaker drop or even someone's attention scarcity makes things irresistible and here's the disturbing part it's one of the most exploited psychological tricks in existence think about Black Friday every year people trample over each other for discounted TVs and microwaves not because they desperately need them but because they've been told supplies are running out stores manufactur scarcity creating the illusion of high demand it doesn't matter if the same product is available next week in that moment people act impulsively driven by fear of missing out this trick hijacks your brain at the deepest level when something is scarce your survival instincts kick in thousands of years ago scarcity meant life or death if food water or shelter was limited you fought for it that instinct still lingers today making you irrationally chase anything that seems rare even if you don't need it it it's why luxury Brands limit production the fewer handbags the more people crave them it's why social media influencers post exclusive content behind pay walls the illusion of scarcity makes it seem more valuable and it's why dating apps make people obsessed over someone who isn't available the less you can have them the more you want them but this psychological trick isn't just about selling products it's been used to manipulate entire societies totalitarian regimes restrict information making people desperate for what they can't access cult leaders use it to control followers convincing them that only they have the truth and the outside world offers nothing and the most unsettling part scarcity makes people blind to logic when you believe something is slipping away you stop asking if you even want it in the first place exploit the need for closure some questions never stop echoing in the back of your mind why did they leave what really happened what was the truth that Goring uncertainty that feeling of unfinished business it's not just a minor frustration it's a powerful psychological Force known as the need for closure and when someone understands just how much you crave a definitive answer they can use that against you in ways you'd never expect the need for closure is a fundamental part of human cognition our brains hate Loose Ends when something is unresolved our minds work overtime trying to make sense of it we fill in the gaps we create explanations we latch onto anything that gives us a sense of finality and this is exactly where manipulation begins take relationships for example have you ever heard of someone staying obsessed with an ex not because they want them back but because they never got a real explanation for why things ended That's The Power of an open psychological Loop when a breakup happens abruptly without clear reasoning it leaves a hole in the person's mind they replay every interaction searching for Clues obsessing over possible answers and if the person who left them hanging ever returns even with a weak or dishonest excuse their brain grabs onto it just to satisfy that desperate need for closure manipulators know this they disappear suddenly only to return later with vague explanations knowing their victims will be too relieved to question the lies but this tactic isn't just used in personal relationships it's weaponized on a much larger scale look at Cults one of the most effective ways cult leaders keep their followers under control is by dangling half revealed Secrets they tell their followers that they're on the verge of learning something lifechanging but they just need to prove themselves first that proof it's endless more loyalty more obedience more sacrifice but the truth is there is no great secret just a psychological trick to keep people trapped in an endless cycle of searching even in politics the need for closure is one of the most powerful tools of mass persuasion political propaganda often thrives on ambiguity a politician might claim there's something they're not telling you or the real story story is out there if you look hard enough they don't provide facts just enough uncertainty to make people start filling in the blanks themselves and here's the dark part when people are forced to create their own explanations they tend to believe them more strongly than actual facts marketers also use this trick every single day Cliffhangers vague advertisements mysterious teasers all designed to keep you hooked noticed how TV shows end with unresolved plot lines or how a Brand hints at an exciting product reveal but gives no details they do this because they know your mind won't let it go you'll keep thinking about it looking for Clues searching for answers until you give in and buy whatever they're selling but here's where it gets really unsettling our need for closure makes us accept any answer even if it's false studies show that when people are desperate for resolution they they become far more susceptible to misinformation conspiracy theories and outright lies it's easier to believe a convenient lie than to live with lingering uncertainty this is why cult members cling to false teachings why people fall for scams and why entire populations can be led to believe completely fabricated narratives and the worst part the more we seek closure the easier we are to manipulate the more we demand answers the more control we give to those willing to provide them because in the end whoever controls the answers controls the Mind micromanipulation imagine this you're in a conversation Everything feels normal but after a few minutes your thoughts shift you start questioning your choices feeling guilty for things you never second guessed before the person across from you never raised their voice never made a direct demand and yet somehow they've nudged your mind in a completely different direction without you even realizing it this is micr manipulation the subtle almost imperceptible tactics that control people's decisions beliefs and behaviors without them noticing unlike obvious coercion or deception micromanipulation works like slow poison Drip by drip small adjustments that push you exactly where they want you take the foot inth door tactic a classic in sales and persuasion a company might first ask you to sign a harmless petition something that aligns with your values then days later they come back asking for a donation because you've already said yes once your brain leans toward consistency you don't realize it but that tiny First Agreement was a setup conditioning you to comply with a bigger requ Quest later but micromanipulation isn't just about persuasion it's about control in toxic relationships manipulators use this trick masterfully imagine a partner who never outright demands obedience but instead raises an eyebrow sigh at the right moment or gives a subtle pause before responding over time these tiny cues make you adjust your behavior to avoid their disapproval even if they never explicitly asked you to change workplace environments can be just as dangerous ever had a boss who casually mentioned how another employee stayed late to finish a project they never directly told you to work extra hours but suddenly you feel obligated this is how micromanipulation Works planting ideas without stating them outright and then there's social conditioning micr manipulation is used on a massive scale in politics advertising and media consider how Brands create artificial exclusivity only five left in stock or this deal won't last they subtly influencing urgency making you act without thinking it's not manipulation in the way you expect it's worse because you still think you're making the choice yourself one of the darkest applications of micromanipulation is in gaslighting a manipulator doesn't need to outright call you crazy they just need to question your memory reframe the narrative and downplay events subtly enough to make you doubt yourself they might say I don't think I ever said that are you sure you're remembering correctly it sounds innocent enough but over time it erodes confidence making the victim more pliable more dependent this is why micromanipulation is so terrifying it doesn't look like manipulation at all it feels like your own thoughts your own decisions your own reasoning it works through gestures phrasing timing and tone all carefully calibrated to steer you in a specific Direction and the worst part once someone Masters micromanipulation they can make you believe that their ideas were yours all along the zonic effect you ever notice how an unfinished task lingers in your mind like an itch you can't scratch a song that cuts off before the final chorus a movie that stops just before the climax it's unbearable your brain refuses to let it go that's the zonic effect and it's one of the most Sinister psychological tricks ever discovered now imagine if someone weaponized that feeling if they deliberately left things unresolved just to keep you hooked anxious and desperate for closure this isn't just a psychological Quirk it's a tool of manipulation used everywhere from marketing to mind control the effect is named after blumer zonic a Soviet psychologist who discovered something strange while observing waiters in a cafe they could remember every detail of unpaid orders but immediately forgot them once the bill was settled in other words the brain prioritizes unfinished business Loose Ends demand attention advertisers exploit this mercilessly think about Cliffhangers in TV shows why does every episode end right when things get interesting because the brain hates incompleteness it fixates on what's left unfinished making you obsessively crave resolution that's why people binge watch entire Seasons it's not just entertainment it's a psychological trap but the real darkness lies in how the zonic effect is used to control people cult leaders manipulative partners and even interrogators intentionally withhold closure to keep their victims mentally trapped a toxic boss who keeps dangling a promotion just Out Of Reach a narcissist who disappears midc conversation leaving you desperate for an answer a political figure who stirs fear but never provides real solutions they all rely on the same tactic leave the brain hanging and it will chase the answer indefinitely and the worst part most people never realize it's happening the pigan effect imagine a teacher walks into a classroom and secretly believes that half the students are geniuses and the other half are average no one tells the students anything no special treatment is given yet by the end of the year The Genius students perform dramatically better than the others why because expectations alone shape their reality this is the palian effect and when used strategically it can mold people like clay without them even realizing it the name comes from the Greek myth of pigmalion a sculptor who fell in love with a statue he created which then came to life in psychology it refers to how beliefs influence behavior when someone expects greatness from you you unconsciously rise to meet it but the reverse is also true low expectations create failure before it even begins a famous real world example the Rosenthal and Jacobson experiment in the 1960s researchers told teachers that certain students randomly chosen were intellectual Bloomers expected to excel the teachers unknowingly treated the these students differently offering them more encouragement patience and subtle signals of belief by the end of the year those students actually became smarter scoring significantly higher on IQ tests now think about how dangerous this becomes when manipulated a controlling boss subtly implies you're incompetent making you second guess your abilities until you actually start underperforming a toxic partner keeps telling you your you're lucky to have them eroding your self-worth so you never consider leaving even entire social groups can be influenced if people are constantly told they're inferior they may start to believe it and act accordingly the palian effect isn't just about belief it's about how expectations shape Destinies and the most terrifying part it happens so gradually you never realize it's controlling you until it's too late reframing failure reframing failure is one of the most subtle yet devastating psychological tricks it's a way to manipulate how you perceive your own mistakes making you feel powerless incompetent or even guilty when failure is framed the right way it stops being a simple setback and becomes something far worse proof that you are not enough and once that idea takes root it can control every decision you make imagine growing up in an environment where every mistake you make isn't just a mistake it's a sign that you are fundamentally flawed you didn't just fail a test you disappointed your parents you didn't just mess up a project you embarrassed yourself in front of your boss reframing failure is all about Shifting the meaning of your mistakes so that they aren't just temporary obstacles but reflections of who you are as a person and the more you believe that the more control someone else has over you take the North Korean regime in that Society failure isn't just about personal shortcomings it's framed as betrayal if you fail to meet work quots you're not just an unproductive worker you're failing the state your family and your leader you're an enemy of progress that kind of reframing forces people into submission because now their failures don't just belong to them they have consequences for everyone around them but this kind of manip ation isn't limited to extreme regimes it happens in workplaces relationships and even everyday conversations have you ever worked for a boss who made you feel like every small mistake meant you weren't cut out for the job that's not just criticism it's reframing instead of failure being a step toward learning it becomes a sign that you are inadequate the more this is reinforced the more people become afraid to take risks speak up or even leave toxic work environments they aren't just scared of failing they are scared that failure means they aren't good enough to succeed in the first place it happens in relationships too a manipulative partner can reframe failure in a way that makes you feel dependent on them they might say things like see you always do this or maybe you're just not capable of being in a relationship suddenly you don't just feel like you made a mistake you start to believe that you are the mistake over time this erodes confidence making you feel like you're lucky to even be tolerated let alone loved and once that idea settles in it's easy for someone to control you one of the darkest aspects of this trick is how it makes people internalize the belief that they deserve their situation if you can convince someone that failure is a reflection of their worth they won't even try to change their circumstances they'll stay in bad jobs in abusive relationships in toxic friendships not because they want to but because they've been made to believe that any attempt to leave will only end in more failure and since failure is tied to their identity they avoid it at all costs the scariest part is that people don't even realize it's happening they blame themselves instead of questioning the person or system that is feeding them this belief they work harder stay quieter shrink themselves down just to avoid that crushing sense of failure but here's the truth failure is not personal it is not permanent and most importantly it is not defined by someone else if someone else controls what failure means to you they might just control you too the halo effect first impressions are powerful but what if I told you they don't just shape how we feel about someone they distort everything we see that's the halo effect a psychological trick so subtle yet so manipulative that it can make someone appear smarter Kinder or even more trustworthy than they actually are simply because of one positive trait and once that Halo is in place it's nearly impossible to break free from its influence imagine you're in a courtroom watching two different defendants on trial for the same crime one is well-dressed well spoken and Carries themselves with confidence the other looks dishevel nervous and avoids eye contact without knowing any details of the case who seems more guilty to you studies show that attractive confident individuals are more likely to be perceived as innocent while those who appear nervous or less polished are assumed to be guilty even if the evidence says otherwise that's the halo effect in action this trick works because the human brain is wired to take shortcuts instead of evaluating every aspect of a person person we latch onto one striking trait like attractiveness charm or intelligence and use it to assume everything else about them if someone is physically attractive we subconsciously believe they must also be kind competent and trustworthy if someone speaks with confidence we assume they must be knowledgeable and if someone is in a position of power we naturally believe they deserve to be there it's why politicians can win elections based on Charisma rather than policy it's why serial manipulators get away with their lies and it's why leaders who appear strong and authoritative are often blindly followed even when their actions are questionable the halo effect isn't just about perception it actively shapes reality think about media coverage celebrities who are admired for their talent often get the benefit of the doubt when scandals emerge while someone already views negatively is instantly condemned it's not logic it's the halo effect distorting judgment marketers exploit this trick to Perfection ever wondered why luxury Brands hire attractive well-dressed models to promote their products it's not just about selling clothes or watches they know that if you associate their brand with beauty and Status you'll subconsciously assume the product itself is superior you're not buying just a car a perfume or a suit you're buying the illusion of prestige that surrounds it but the darker side of the halo effect is its ability to Shield dangerous individuals from scrutiny charismatic leaders can hide corruption behind their charm manipulative Partners can make people ignore red flags simply because they seem caring at first even history's worst figures often had an aura of leadership that blinded people to their true nature until it was too late the halo effect is one of the most Insidious psychological tricks because it doesn't just fool people it makes them confident in their false judgments and once someone believes in an illusion they'll defend it even when evidence contradicts their perception they'll rationalize it away he's a good guy he wouldn't do that she's so Charming she must be telling the truth Breaking Free from the halo effect means questioning First Impressions it means looking past arm status and appearances and asking what am I not seeing because sometimes the people who seem the brightest are simply casting the longest Shadows time constraints imagine you're in a high-end watch store admiring an expensive time piece the salesperson leans in and Whispers this is the last one in stock and I Can Only Hold This price for the next 5 minutes your heart races the pressure builds you weren't planning to buy anything today but suddenly waiting feels like losing this is time constraint as a pressure tactic and it's one of the most effective ways to make people act against their better judgment when faced with a ticking clock rational thinking is the first thing to collapse the brain processes scarcity as a threat a fear of missing out of losing an opportunity that might never come again in response the body releases cortisol spiking stress levels and making quick decisions feel like the only option marketers con artists and even cult leaders know this well by artificially limiting time they create a sense of urgency so intense that people feel forced to act before thinking this trick works because of something called decision fatigue when a person feels rushed they don't have the luxury of weighing pros and cons instead they rely on Instinct they default to the easiest safest feeling Choice which is usually what the manipulator wanted all along that's why limited time offers work so well in sales it's why car dealerships claim a deal will expire by the end of the day even though the same exclusive offer is still there the next week but this tactic goes beyond sales it's been used to control people on a massive scale in High Press negoti iations leaders will impose last minute deadlines forcing their opponents to make rushed agreements Cults and extremist groups use time constraints to trap recruits decide today or this opportunity disappears forever even military interrogators have exploited time pressure bombarding detainees with rapid questions forcing them to respond before they can think critically one of the most disturbing applications of this tactic is in scam culture ever heard of a high stakes email scam you receive a message claiming to be from a bank or government agency warning you that your account is compromised you have 10 minutes to respond or your funds will be frozen rationally you'd verify the claim but the clock is ticking the fear takes over and before you know it you've handed over sensitive information but here's the darkest part the illusion of urgency creates compliance people who normally resist ulation become highly suggestible Under Pressure Studies have shown that when individuals believe they're on a time limit they're far more likely to obey instructions even if those instructions go against their morals instincts or common sense so how do you resist this trap the key is pausing the moment you feel rushed step back recognize that urgency is often manufactured ask yourself is this really my last chance or or is someone just making me feel like it is because the truth is when someone pressures you to decide right now it's usually because they don't want you to think at all the contrast principle imagine you walk into a store to buy a new suit the salesperson greets you with a warm smile and immediately brings out the most expensive option in the store a designer suit that costs well beyond your budget you shake your head saying it's too much but then they show you a second suit still pricey but significantly cheaper than the first suddenly this second suit seems like a bargain and you convince yourself it's a great deal without realizing it you've just fallen for the contrast principle a psychological trick that alters how we perceive value making things seem better or worse depending on what they are compared to this principle works because our brains don't evaluate things in isolation we understand value by comparison a $100 shirt feels absurdly expensive if you've just been looking at $20 shirts but if you've just been shown a $500 jacket that same $100 shirt suddenly feels reasonable this mental shortcut happens so fast that you don't even realize you're being influenced it's one of the most effective persuasion tactics in existence salespeople marketers real estate agents and even high press negotiators you use it constantly ever noticed how luxury car dealerships show you the most expensive models first that's by Design after seeing a car that costs $100,000 a $60,000 car feels like a steal even if it's still outrageously expensive the contrast principle exploits your perception not the actual value of what you're buying but here's where it gets truly dark this trick isn't just used in sales it's used to manipulate Behavior decisions and even how we judge people imagine a company introducing a terrible policy longer work hours fewer benefits employees Revolt refusing to accept it then management compromises by offering a slightly less awful policy suddenly employees feel relieved and accept the new conditions even though they're still much worse than before the trick the second option was always the intended goal the first one was just there to make it look better by comparison this same technique is used in politics and media have you ever noticed how a particularly controversial law or policy is first introduced in its most extreme form outrage follows people demand change then a less extreme version is proposed and people breathe a sigh of relief they accept it not because it's good but because it looks better in contrast to the worse option and then there's the manipulation of Human Relationships let's say someone wants you to accept mistreatment or control they might start by treating you terribly being overly critical or distant then suddenly they give you a small kindness a compliment a gift a moment of attention that kindness feels huge in comparison to the prior mistreatment and suddenly you feel grateful even loyal this is textbook emotional manipulation and it keeps people trapped in toxic relationships or social dynamics they would have rejected outright under normal circumstances what makes this trick so Insidious is that it feels completely natural your brain truly believes the second option is better it doesn't feel like manipulation and once this principle is in play escaping it becomes nearly impossible unless you know what's happening so how do you fight it the key is absolute awareness whenever you're making a decision ask yourself am I judging this based on its actual value or is something else influencing my perception because in the end the real danger of the contrast principle isn't that people use it against you it's that you might never even realize they did the Ikea effect there's a reason why people hold on to ugly homemade crafts why parents cherish their child's clumsy school projects and why assembling a piece of furniture makes it feel more valuable than something ready made it's not the quality it's the effort this is the Ikea effect a psychological trick that makes people overvalue things they've put effort into even if the final product isn't particularly good the effect is named after the famous Furniture Company Ikea which sells affordable flat pack furniture that customers have to assemble themselves the Brilliance of this model isn't just about saving costs it's about creating attachment studies show that when people build something with their own hands they place a significantly higher value on it compared to something preassembled even if the two are identical the act of effort tricks the brain into forming an emotional bond with the object making people less likely to discard it return it or acknowledge its flaws but this trick isn't limited to Furniture businesses Cults and manipulators exploit the Ikea effect in ways that go beyond just making you over value a bookshelf it's used in workplaces when employees are encouraged to contribute ideas that make them feel personally invested in the company's success despite being underpaid or overworked it's used in relationships where one person is constantly made to work for the approval of the other deepening their attachment in a toxic Dynamic it's even used in cult indoctrination where new members are given difficult or humiliating tasks to complete increasing their emotional Investments and making them less likely to question their beliefs the Ikea effect is dangerous because it creates a psychological trap the more effort you pour into something the harder it becomes to walk away even when logic says you should this is why gamblers keep betting after losing money why people stay in failing relationships long after the love is gone and why employees remain loyal to toxic companies the Mind convinces itself that because so much work was put in it must be worth it and here's the real danger this effect doesn't just apply to objects and relationships it can shape entire belief systems political ideologies conspiracy theories even dangerous movements once someone has invested time effort and personal identity into something it becomes nearly impossible for them to let go they'd rather twist reality to protect their belief than admit they wasted their effort on something meaningless so the next time time you feel deeply attached to something ask yourself do you truly value it or have you just put in too much work to walk away the decoy effect the next time you buy something stop and ask yourself did you actually choose this or were you led to it because what if I told you that many of your decisions weren't really yours at all but carefully engineered by an invisible trick known as the decoy effect this psychological trick is so subtle so effective that corporations advertisers and even political strategists use it to guide your choices without you ever realizing it it works by presenting you with three options but one of them isn't really there to be picked it's just bait to push you toward a specific decision and once you see it in action you'll start questioning every choice you've ever made let's take a simple example you walk into a movie theater and you're given two choices a small popcorn for $3 or a large for $7 most people might have hesitate $7 seems like a steep jump from three but now the theater adds a third option A medium popcorn for $6.50 suddenly $7 for a large doesn't seem so bad anymore that 50 c difference makes the large feel like the obvious best deal you were never meant to pick the medium it was only there to steer you toward the large this trick isn't just used in concession stands you'll find it everywhere in subscription Services where the best value plan sits comfortably next to an overpriced intentionally unattractive alternative in restaurants where menu pricing is designed to make a certain dish look like the best deal even in elections where a strategically placed Third Party candidate can pull just enough votes from one side to shift the results but here's where it gets disturbing the decoy effect doesn't just shape our purchases it influences our perceptions of value quality and even morality have you ever seen a public figure get away with something terrible just because someone else did something worse that's the decoy effect by introducing a more extreme alternative the original choice suddenly feels more acceptable even if it was never truly a good option and the worst part the more decisions you make under the influence of this trick the more your brain starts to justify them you convince yourself that you chose the best deal that your vote was independent that your moral compass was unshaken but in reality you were nudged manipulated and guided toward an outcome that was never really your choice to begin with so the next time you're faced with three options look closer because one of them might not actually be a choice at all the placebo effect they handed you a pill you swallowed it and within minutes the pain started fading relief washed over you your body responding just as expected but what if I I told you that pill was nothing more than sugar no medicine no active ingredients and yet your brain believed it worked so it did this is the placebo effect one of the most unsettling psychological phenomena ever discovered it proves that belief alone has the power to change the body and while it might sound like an interesting Quirk of human psychology its implications are far darker than you think let's start with a well-known case in the 1950s a man named Mr Wright was dying of terminal cancer his doctor out of desperation gave him an injection of what was supposed to be a breakthrough drug the results were miraculous his tumors shrank and he made a full recovery but here's the twist the drug was completely ineffective when Mr Wright later found out his cancer returned almost instantly and he died shortly after this is the power of belief when the mind is convinced something is working the body follows Studies have shown that people given fake painkillers release real endorphins Placebo surgeries where doctors pretend to operate have led to genuine improvements in patients even Parkinson's patients have seen symptoms improve simply because they thought they were receiving medication and yet here's where it gets deeply unsettling this effect can be weaponized if belief can heal then it can also harm this is called the nobo effect the dark twin of the placebo effect instead of convincing people they're getting better you convince them they're getting worse tell someone a harmless pill will make them sick and their body will create real symptoms nausea pain even full-blown diseases this has been used throughout history in Voodoo cultures shamans have cursed people to death simply by making them believe they were dying in medical scams con artists sell completely fake treatments making people think they're recovering until it's too late and in modern pharmaceutical trials patients sometimes experience serious side effects not because of the drug but because their minds expect them think about what this means if belief is strong enough to change your biology then how many times in your life have you been tricked how often has your pain your relief your sickness even your recovery been dictated by expectation rather than reality and more importantly who's been shaping those expectations loss aversion they put two choices in front of you option A you gain $100 option b you lose $100 which one feels stronger if you're like most people the pain of losing that money hits twice as hard as the joy of gaining it this is loss aversion a psychological trick that makes you fear losing far more than you desire winning and this fear it controls more of your decisions than you realize think about casinos they know this effect inside out when you start winning they flood you with flashing lights and celebratory sounds conditioning your brain to crave more but when you lose they don't make a big deal out of it no alarms no dramatic music just silence why because they know you're already in psychological pain and here's the kicker people who lose money don't just walk away they chase their losses they keep gambling desperate to avoid feeling that loss permanently loss aversion isn't just about gambling it shapes everything from marketing to relationships ever wondered why companies offer limited time deals why e-commerce sites tell you only two left in stock it's because your brain panics at the idea of losing an opportunity you might not even need the product but the moment you think it's about to slip through your fingers you suddenly need to have it now take this further intoxic relationships manipulators weaponize loss aversion to keep people trapped they create fear not of what they give but of what they could take away they make you believe that without them you'd be alone unloved or worse this is why people stay in situations that harm them it's not because they're happy it's because the idea of losing what they have no matter how bad feels more terrifying than walking away and if you think you're immune think again every day politicians advertisers and even social media exploit this exact principle act now or miss out forever your rights are being taken away everyone else is ahead of you the world isn't just feeding you choices it's making sure you fear the wrong ones so the question is how many of your decisions were truly yours and how many were just a desperate attempt to avoid losing the power of touch the warmth of a handshake a reassuring pat on the back a brush of fingertips on your arm these small almost imperceptible touches might seem harmless even insignificant but what if I told you that they hold the power to control your thoughts influence your decisions and change the way you see the world this is the power of touch a psychological weapon so subtle that most people never even notice when it's being used against them and yet it can shape behavior in ways that are almost impossible to resist let's start with an unsettling study in a classic experiment waiters in restaurants were told to lightly touch customers on the shoulder or forearm while returning their change the result tips increased by as much as 40% another study had job interviewers give a brief seemingly insignificant handshake to candidates those who received a firm confident touch were consistently rated as more competent and hirable regardless of their actual performance the explanation lies deep in human psychology touch is the oldest most Primal form of communic communication before language before speech touch was how humans bonded how we reassured how we signal dominance or submission and that instinct hasn't disappeared it's just been repurposed so how does this trick work it's all about subconscious trust and compliance when someone touches you especially lightly and briefly it creates an instant sense of connection you might not consciously notice it but your brain does it registers warmth familiarity even Authority in fact research shows that when a doctor lightly touches a patient's arm while giving a diagnosis the patient is more likely to believe them and follow their advice it's the same reason politicians shake hands obsessively and salespeople make subtle reassuring contact now here's where it gets dark this effect works even when you don't want it to Studies have shown that even unwanted t when not overtly aggressive can lower a person's ability to resist persuasion criminals con artists and manipulators use this to their advantage a cult leader might place a hand on your shoulder while speaking making you feel indebted to them a skilled interrogator might use a light touch on the arm to make you more likely to reveal information even scammers use Touch often brushing against their targets while talking subtly making them more Cooperative this technique is also used in power dynamics ever noticed how powerful people in business or politics Will place a hand on someone's back as they walk through a door that's not just a friendly gesture it's a display of dominance they are quite literally guiding the other person showing who's in control and more often than not the person being touched subconsciously accepts that control and yet here's the most disturbing part it works even when you know about it even now after hearing all of this your brain is still wired to respond to touch the way it always has the next time someone touches your arm your mind will still associate it with warmth trust or authority you might question it later but in the moment your defenses are already lowered so the next time you feel a hand on your shoulder a fleeting touch on your arm or an familiar warmth in a handshake ask yourself was that an accident or was it a calculated move to make you just a little more obedient the foot and mouth effect most people think that being polite and friendly will always work in their favor but what if I told you that simply making small talk expressing warmth or even asking someone how they're doing could make you more vulnerable to manipulation this is where the foot and mouth effect comes into play a psychological trick that exploits our own need to be perceived as kind agreeable and emotionally invested and once someone knows how to use it against you they can shape your decisions without you even realizing it one of the most well-documented examples of this effect comes from a study conducted by social psychologists Howard and gangler they found that when people were first asked a simple seemingly harmless question like how are you feeling today they were significant L more likely to comply with a later request even if that request had nothing to do with the conversation this is because once someone verbalizes something about themselves especially something positive they subconsciously feel the need to maintain that image through their actions if you tell someone you're having a good day it becomes harder to refuse a favor right after because denying them would contradict the positivity you just expressed this trick is widely used in sales negotiations and even interrogations a skilled salesperson won't just jump into their pitch instead they'll start with light conversation asking about your day or making small personal observations the moment you respond with something like I'm doing well thanks for asking you've unknowingly put yourself in a psychological trap you now feel the need to remain consistent with the friendly Cooperative Persona you just projected so when they ask if you'd like to just take a quick look at a product or consider an option you're far more likely to comply even if you originally had no intention of doing so in high stakes environments like police interrogations or intelligence gathering this trick becomes even more Sinister interrogators might begin with harmless casual questions designed to get the suspect talking in a relaxed and Cooperative manner once the person starts responding positively they unconsciously want to maintain that Cooperative stance making it easier for interrogators to extract information or subtly lead them toward a confession it's a psychological doorway once you step through it's hard to turn back without feeling like you're contradicting yourself but why does this happen the foot in mouth effect works because humans are deeply wired for consistency once we say something out loud especially in front of others we feel an internal pressure to align our actions with our words social norms reinforce this Behavior making us uncomfortable with seeming dishonest rude or contradictory if you say I love helping people and someone follows up with a request for help rejecting them feels like you're going against your own nature even if helping them was never part of your plan this tactic isn't just used on individ uals it works on large scale manipulation as well political campaigns and propaganda often Begin by getting the public to agree with simple seemingly harmless statements like we all want a better future once people acknowledge that idea they're primed to support more specific policies that align with it even if those policies weren't something they originally agreed with by getting people to say yes to Broad agreeable ideas first they can guide them toward more extreme commitments later on so how do you protect yourself from falling into this trap the first step is recognizing when it's happening if a conversation starts with an unusually friendly or probing question before leading into a request take a mental step back remind yourself that just because you express positivity doesn't mean you owe anything in return learn to separate polite conversation from compliance and don't let your own words be used against you in the end the foot and mouth effect is a psychological trick that thrives on the simple Act of speaking it turns your own words into a tool of persuasion trapping you in a cycle of consistency the moment you say something you feel compelled to act in a way that aligns with it even if it's against your best interests and once someone knows how to use that against you it's disturbingly easy to push you toward choices you never intended to to make the endowment effect the endowment effect is one of the most Insidious psychological tricks because it exploits something deeply personal our attachment to what we believe is ours once we own something even for a short time we assign it more value than it objectively deserves this quirk in human behavior can be used to manipulate decisions emotions and even Financial choices in ways most people never see coming imagine this you walk into a store and a salesperson hands you an expensive feeling pen telling you to test it out as you roll it between your fingers writing a few lines it starts to feel like yours suddenly when the price is revealed it seems reasonable even if you never intended to spend that much on a pen that's the endowment effect at work simply touching or using something tricks your brain into believing you own it making it harder to let go but it doesn't stop with physical objects the endowment effect is weaponized in everything from marketing to high stakes negotiations free trials test drives and limited time demos all work because they create a sense of ownership before you've spent a dime once something feels like yours giving it up feels like losing a part of yourself retailers know this which is why they let you borrow their products before committing it's even more dangerous when applied to ideas and beliefs people become irrationally attached to opinions simply because they've held them for a long time this is why changing someone's mind even with undeniable facts is so difficult if they feel ownership over a belief letting go of it feels like a personal loss the endowment effect also plays a role in relationships people stay in toxic friendships and unhealthy romances because they feel invested they've spent years building something and the thought of walking away feels like losing everything but the truth is that's just the illusion of value the same trick that convinces you an old broken phone in your drawer is worth more than it actually is when this trick is used strategically it can be devastating Cults con artists and manipulative leaders rely on it to keep followers Locked In by making people feel like they own their choices their place in a group or even their suffering they make Escape feel impossible the deeper the investment the stronger the illusion of value and here's the most unsettling part the endowment effect works even when you know about it it doesn't matter if you're aware of the trick your brain still clings to what feels like it belongs to you the only way to break free is to recognize when you're valuing something more just because it's in your possession because sometimes what feels PR precious is just a well-placed illusion mind control what if I told you that your thoughts your beliefs your opinions even your memories could be Rewritten that right now without realizing it someone could be bending your mind to their will no Force no obvious manipulation just subtle calculated influence sounds like science fiction right but it's real and it happens far more often than you think take the St for prison experiment one of the most infamous psychological studies ever conducted in 1971 researchers at Stanford University recruited 24 ordinary students dividing them into guards and prisoners for a simulated prison no one was forced no one was brainwashed and yet within days the guards regular college students became cruel authoritarian even sadistic they humiliated the prisoners forced them into stress positions even denied them basic necessities and the prisoners they broke down emotionally and mentally accepting their abuse as if it were real all of this happened not because anyone told them to but because of psychological erosion the slow Insidious breakdown of personal identity under the right conditions the first step isolation remove people from their normal environment and they become vulnerable their reality shrinks their world Narrows to whatever they're told the prisoners in the experiment weren't physically trapped but psychologically they were and it's not just experiments or Cults where this happens governments corporations even toxic relationships control thrives where people stop questioning the human brain craves patterns repetition familiarity if you hear something often enough it starts feeling true even if it isn't that's why propaganda works that's why conspiracy theories spread that's why some people defend beliefs that are actively harming them then there's fear the most powerful tool of all when people are afraid they seek security and the easiest way to control someone offer them certainty authoritarian leaders create external enemies cult leaders predict the end of the world manipulative Partners turn you against your friends the goal is the same keep you scared keep you dependent keep you from thinking too much because once fear takes hold your mind Narrows you stop questioning and once that happens control is complete that's what makes this the darkest psychology trick of all it doesn't doesn't force you to change it makes you want to and by the time you realize what's happened if you ever do it's already too late the power of playing dumb there's a saying never underestimate the power of a fool but what if the fool isn't really a fool at all what if playing dumb is a carefully crafted manipulation tool a way to control situations lower people's defenses and gain the upper hand without them ever realizing it the power of playing dumb is one of the most underestimated psychological tricks yet it's been used for Centuries by politicians criminals and even everyday manipulators one of the most well-known examples of this trick in action is the legendary detective Columbo he was famous for his disheveled appearance slow speech and almost clueless demeanor every suspect underestimated him dismissing him as a bumbling officer until he caught them in their own contradictions that's the essence of this tactic when you appear less competent or less intelligent people reveal more than they intend to they drop their guard assuming they are in control but how exactly does this work first playing dumb gives the illusion of harmlessness if someone appears clueless they don't seem like a threat people are naturally inclined to take charge when they perceive someone else as struggling which puts the dumb person in a position to be underestimated this is a especially effective in negotiations social interactions and even legal situations by pretending to be oblivious the manipulator gathers information without suspicion they let others overe explain fill in details and unknowingly expose their weaknesses then there's the art of selective incompetence pretending not to know how to do something so that others step in and take responsibility employees use this trick all the time to avoid extra work a person who doesn't know how to set up a presentation cook a meal or fix a computer might be fully capable but by feigning ignorance they push the responsibility onto someone else it's a passive form of control one that forces others to step in do the work and ultimately hand over power this trick also thrives in Social manipulation have you ever noticed how some people pretend to misunderstand or misinterpret a situation just to avoid accountability by acting confused or unaware they Dodge blame when caught in a lie a manipulator might say oh I had no idea that's what you meant or I must have misunderstood this forces the other person to second guess their own stance making them appear unreasonable for holding the manipulator accountable but the darkest side of this trick is its ability to exhaust and frustrate its

The old tupy like the fruit. They take it. They grow it. They eat it. Nas. The old ti like it so much they share it with their not old, not tupy friends. Nas. The friends like the fruit. They take it. They grow it. No, they don't. They sail to Guadaloop. Why? Why not? Then they grow it and they eat it. Who's they? The Kalanago. They aren't old. They're like Guadaloop, though. And Nanas. They grow and eat Nanas until 1492. It's 1492. Something is about to happen. Now it's 1493. What happens? Something happens. For the sake of the video, the Kalanarago go to the coastline. The Spanish are here, led by an Italian guy, Christopher Columbus. They came from Spain and sailed west thinking they'd reached the East Indies, east of the Indies. Idiots. They're in Guadaloop. Chris doesn't know that though, so he calls the Kalenago Indians. Idiot. Idiot. Anyway, he's Italian, meaning he speaks Spanish. Wait, what? Never mind. But the Kalenago don't know. The Spaniards like the fruit. They take it. They introduce smallox. Idiots. Columbus also forgets the fruit's name, calling it Pyad Indis or pine of the Indies. Double idiot. Anyway, he's gone now. We have to go back to Brazil. Why? The Portuguese are here, led by a Portuguese guy. They came from Portugal and sailed west thinking they'd reach India. But Brazil was in the way, idiots. Anyway, remember the old Tupi? They're the new Tupi now. Otherwise, the Tupi, they speak Tupi. The Portuguese speak Portuguese, not Tupi. How would they communicate? Nanasi, who the hell are you? That guy speaks Tupi guarani. It's like Tupi, but a bit guani, hence the hyphen. He also has another word for pineapple. The Portuguese have quite the dilemma. Which word will they choose? They get confused and pick both. Anyway, they're gone now. Colombian exchange. Time for European introduction of the Wait, we have three different words for the same fruit. That won't work. Right. So, that one's strange and has an X in it, so that can go. And the Spanish one is far too long. Wait, what if we shorten it to pinion? Well, it still means two things. And it has that weird Spanish N, which doesn't really exist outside of Spanish. So, let's choose Nanas and pimp it out of it. It has three A's now and an accent. Why? Why not? The big exotic spiky thing is shown to Europe. Ananas. Europe likes the fruit. They take it. They grow it. No, they don't. It's not jungly enough. So, some people go back to the jungle and enslave the jungle people. They also take it to Africa, which is jungly enough. What are we growing? Ask the African jungle people. Ananas. Ananas. Now, a lot of Africa says Ananas. Anasi. Close enough. The French who also say ananas also take an ananas to Africa where it's jungly enough spreading the word. Spain doesn't say ananas. They still like pina even though it means pine cone and yen is weird. Idiots. They trade pine cones to their American colonies but also to the Philippines. Why are you selling us pine cones? Ask the Filipinos. They aren't pine cones. Why are they called pine cones? Because they look like pine cones. Then what makes pña pña? We have to go back to Africa where it's jungly enough. Why the Portuguese? What about them? They're coming. They stopped in India to make a trade post, but also because it's jungly enough. What are we trading? Ask the Indian jungly people. And you get the idea. They take it, they grow it, they No, you don't. Sharing is caring. I wonder what the Saudis will call it. Wait, what? Oh, it still means anas. Anyway, the Portuguese are coming. They spread ananas to Indonesia because it's jungly enough. Now, the Dutch East India Company is coming. They also say Ananas, but they want the spices in East India, hence the name uh Ananas. The Dutch scare the Portuguese off and spread Ananas even further. They even go to Japan. They think about colonizing Japan, but they're kind of scary and not jungly enough. They give them an in Sweden. Actually, a bunch of people were just born, but this someone is important. What's your name again? He was just born. Let's wait 40 years or so. What's your name again? I'm Why does Ananas have so many names? So confusing. I give it one name corresponding to related species. I do the same for 12,000 other species. Yeah, awesome. Now all the science people say Ananas too and live happily ever after. Are we done? No. The jungly Spanish American colonies think Pina is stupid and the Spanish are idiots. So they keep the tupi name ananas. Some even dropped the s. Are we done? No. The Japanese kept the ti name too. Ananasu but only for the plant. The fruit is called pineappuru. What? Why? It came from the English who named the fruit pineapple. What? Why? They didn't like ananas. Instead, they named it pineapple after pine cone because it looked like a pineapple which was the old word for pine cone. Anyway, they named the pineapple the pineapple and changed the pine cones name from pineapple to pine cone. Since the pineapple was the pineapple, so the pine cone couldn't be a pineapple. He also spread the word pineapple, meaning pine cone, to their own colonies. But some places stuck with calling the pineapple ananas since the early bird gets to name the pineapple pine cone. I think we're done. Are we done? Yes. But remember, never touch other people's pineapples without their consent."

      "hook_full_transcript": "have you ever found yourself sitting down to do some work and no matter how hard you try you just can't seem to focus you keep looking out the window checking your phone and 10 minutes feels like an hour fortunately there is a solution to help you fight procrastination and achieve a state of deep flow in work you may not even enjoy doing unfortunately most people won't do it so what is this miracle kill boredom a heavily neglected and stigmatized part of modern society acting as both the problem and the solution hit me up social psychologist Timothy Wilson conducts the study placing Volunteers in a room with nothing but a button if pressed they would receive an electric shock after 15 minutes of sitting in an unfurnished completely empty room alone 67 of males and 25 of females chose to willingly electrocute themselves over doing nothing with some participants deciding to press the button multiple times it is also worth pointing out that the volunteers had previously stated that they would be willing to pay money to avoid the pain of such an electric shot if we read in between the lines of this study it perfectly illustrates how boredom can be utilized as a tool incentivizing you to be more productive imagine you locked yourself in a room with nothing but the work you need to complete getting rid of all distractions like your phone making it either do work or do nothing you will find yourself choosing to do the work most of the time as sitting doing nothing is uncomfortable even borderline painful you will also find the work far more stimulating and entertaining than it would have otherwise been if you had other options of where you could direct your attention allowing you to remain more focused the simple Act of checking your emails for 30 seconds in the middle of a work block puts your mind in a more destructive state for up to 30 minutes after the initial check according to Cowan Newport author of the best-selling book deep work who calls this switching between two different tasks attention and residue being likely to demonstrate poor performance on that next desk the ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy as a consequence the few who cultivate the skill and the make it the core of their working life will thrive on the flip side boredom is equally important in Breaking you out or feeling complacent and Comfortably Numb over stimulation being the reason for the vast majority of the population remaining in a sub-optimal lifestyle sued by video games and social media living a life directed by impulsivity rather than intentionality as Navarre said on the Joe Rogan podcast all of man's problems arise because he cannot sit by himself in a room for 30 minutes alone and it's very true I always needed to be stimulated and when the iPhone came along boredom was dead do you think Christopher Columbus would have embarked on his voyage and discovered America if he lived in a world where he could get jacked up on Prozac and play Minecraft its lack of stimulation which allows us to stop tearing up our brains and think clearly naturally allowing novel ideas to flow the need for constant stimulation is what keeps you trapped in a Comfortably Numb state where development feels unnecessary because life is just good enough great nowadays my friend because most people are weak [Music] a week find that extra cause it sucks it's miserable it's lonely here are the key principles for getting into a state of deep work or flow allocating certain hours of the day dedicated to only deep work with a go-to space there's minimal distractions where you can carry out this work as to also create an association so your brain knows that when you were there that is time for work write down what you want to get done each sessions you don't waste time trying to figure out when you're meant to be working thus avoiding future distractions before you sit down to do the work make sure you have everything you need such as water name to minimize unnecessary breaks and being broken out of the state of flow next try and perform a grand gesture such as investing time or money into improving your deep work routine such as moving out of your house for a week with the intention of only working when you're away or just by investing in a good pair of noise canceling headphones or raise the perceived importance of the task allowing you to work more efficiently and better integrate it into your routine making it a long lasting habit finally one of the most overlooked aspects of getting into deep work is downtime in your breaks between blocks go for a walk take a nap or meditate A good rule is to only do things that are low stimulation during this downtime otherwise as previously mentioned will create attention residue creating a more clouded brain as your mind can't change between stimulating tasks well carrying the thoughts of one over to the other a bonus tip to improve focus is to listen to binaural beats at 40 Hertz which has been shown in multiple studies to improve concentration in part by increasing the levels of neurochemical dopamine and acetylcholine in the brain you can do this throughout the whole of your work session or you can just listen to five minutes of the binaural beats prior to the session as a formal warm-up the same way you would warm up for exercise foreign"

      "hook_full_transcript": "Most people think success is about discipline or working more hours. And sure, they will get you to the top 10%. But to reach the top 1%, the rules are completely different. I was once homeless and I thought I was a failure. Today, I'm a multi-millionaire investor, board member, adviser, two billion dollar tech companies. And I didn't get there by working harder, but by designing systems that did the hard work for me. So instead of giving you motivational fluff, I'm going to share five simple principles to finally do the hard things you've been avoiding. Principle number one, you need to trap yourself. In 1519, the Spanish concistador Hernand Cortez landed on the shores of Mexico with just a few hundred men. They were there to conquer the Aztec Empire. Now, they were outnumbered in an unknown land, facing impossible odds. Now, guess what he did to make sure his troops had no option but to win. Cortez ordered them to sink the ships. There was no going back, no retreat, no surrender. That's exactly what we need to do in our lives because when you don't have a plan B, you will find a way to make plan A work. I learned that lesson in my career when I was the chief operating officer at a large company [music] and we acquired a new company and it was an adjacent business uh with an attractive revenue stream and several hundreds of employees joined us [music] and they had a terrific management team but they were in a different [music] city and there were no direct flights from New York. So I wasn't sure if I was going to travel there much. But when you acquire a company, you have to put in a lot of time and effort to integrate the two companies. People, [music] culture, systems, product, customers, all of that has to come together. And I remember my CEO putting his hand on my shoulder and saying just two lines, okay, man, I'm not going there. You own it. And that was it. And at that moment, the whole idea of traveling there every week didn't seem like a chore or a choice. That became my plan A. And there was no plan B. We had to make the deal work. We had to make the integration successful. And that required me to pay full attention to the acquired company because my CEO was going to work on a larger picture. [music] and he trusted me fully to take care of our new employees and make sure we became one company. In behavioral design, these are called forcing functions. The constraints that corner you and force you into growth. Here are the four forcing functions you can set for yourself. First, public commitment. Tell people what you're going to do. Announce [music] it. Social pressure is one of the oldest motivators on earth. Second, [music] financial stakes. Pay before you feel ready. Like putting money down on that gym membership or that training course that you always wanted to take. Our example of that acquisition was a financial state. We spent a lot of money. We had to make it successful. Third, cut the access. [music] Delete the app. Block the site. If things that distract you aren't available easily, it becomes a forcing function itself. And fourth, time box. Give the task a hard window. 90 minutes ship something at the end of it. You know when retreat is not an option, hard things that seemed impenetrable first become inevitable. This lets you overcome one thing everybody blames when they can't stay consistent. That's when principle number two comes into play. Do you know what that is? It's willpower. We've all had those days. It's 800 am and you feel like it's going to be an amazing day. You're gonna get so much done today. And then it's 800 PM and you've renegotiated almost everything from your list and you feel like you have failed, but you haven't. That's just how our brains work. Yours and mine. One of the world's leading willpower researchers, Roy Balmeister, ran a study that literally flipped the idea of discipline on its head. For me, at least. He brought people into his lap and put fresh baked cookies in front of them. Now, half of them were told not to eat them. Don't touch it. The other half wasn't told anything. And after a while, some of them ate cookies, some of them didn't. Both groups were given a set of impossible puzzles to solve. And now you're going to say, \"Of course, I know where this story is going.\" Those with the willpower did better. But that's the twist. Those who resisted eating cookies gave up on puzzles 50% faster. Now, that completely surprised me, too. But there is an explanation. Our willpower isn't infinite. It's like a fuel tank. Every decision you make and every distraction you fight ends up draining that tank. So, by evening, the tank's going to be empty. That's why you feel like you failed. Not having willpower is not a sign of failure or weakness. It's just biology. Judges deny parole more often in the afternoon than in the morning. Same cases, same type [music] of facts, but their mental fuel is depleting. We keep trying to solve a biological problem with vague solutions like willpower. Noah Li is the world's fastest man right now. Now, he doesn't chase willpower or discipline. He engineers it. How? Well, he has ADHD. So, he doesn't trust willpower. He trusts his internal rhythm. 6 days a week, same track, same playlist, same warm-up, same bodily movements. When the gun goes off, he says, \"I'm not thinking. My body already knows what to do.\" That's not discipline. That's [music] design. He's not fighting biology. He's using it. When the margin between a gold medal and a silver is just 1 500th of a second, those routines give him the edge. So why not use the same logic to your advantage? Pick one task that you've been avoiding for a while or the task that has been avoiding you for a while and lock the three variables, time, place, and trigger. Let's say it's deep work that you want to do and it's always 9:00 a.m. on Thursday. And so at 9:00 am on Thursday on your deep work day, show up at the same desk, same playlist, phone on airplane mode, no Slack, no email. Now you're on autopilot. [music] That sounds terribly simple, right? But that's the point. Simple systems are the hardest [music] to break. The more you force yourself into these kind of rhythms, the less you have to rely on willpower anymore. Instead, you'll be able to take advantage of your mental algorithm. A psychologist at NYU, Peter Galwitzer, studied students who were trying to exercise over Christmas break. And he did something very interesting. He divided them into two groups. One group was told to set goals like, \"I want to work out more.\" And the other group was given something like an if then plan. So, if X, do y. If it's Monday at 7 a.m., then you were at the gym. Both teams had the same motivation, but two different instructions. And the results were so surprising. [music] The goal setters failed 62% of the time, but the if then planners only failed 9% of the time. That's just how our mental algorithms work. [music] If X, then Y. If this happens, do that. It's a simple but powerful system that changes your behavior. We avoid hard things because what we're really trying to avoid is the emotion that comes from it. The frustration, the doubt, discomfort, the uneasy feeling, the imposttor syndrome. So your brain starts bargaining with you. Let's skip this just just for today. You know, promise tomorrow we'll do it twice. It doesn't work, does it? The fix. Run the algorithm. [music] Why? Because the if then algorithm helps you see those emotional bargains as just data signals. You take out the drama, you take out the debate, and in your head, you just run the code. If it's 3:00 p.m. Thursday, your deep work starts. If you had lunch, you walk for 15 minutes. If it's Friday afternoon, you review your week. If it's Sunday night, plan for the next week. Whatever it is that you want to program in your if then algorithm, you can do it. and then execute. Take out the debate. But here's what most people don't realize. Even with all these systems in [music] place, there is one step that makes everything stick to outsource your decisions. Atul Gawande is a famous surgeon and he was curious about surgical errors. While he was doing his research, he found something very disturbing. [music] That worldclass surgeons were making so many mistakes that were totally preventable. [music] They knew better. But somehow under pressure, their performance was uneven. So he worked with the World Health Organization and they developed a 19step surgical checklist. And you will think the list would be like super technical, right? But it had the simplest things like confirm the patient's identity first. Make sure all the antibiotics are given. Make sure that the right leg to operate on is marked so you don't chop off the left leg. That kind of stuff. Now you think, wait, this is so elementary. But when the hospitals put this simple system of checklists into practice, postsurgical complications fell by 36%. and deaths dropped by 47%. Same surgeons, same skills, just a simple checklist as a safety net when their cognitive load was peaking. That's the power of the system working for you. And the paradox here is that the better you get at mastering something, the more structured the systems you will have to rely on. Checklists aren't just for beginners, they are for experts, especially experts who do hard things. That's why pilots with 10,000 hours of flying still read the same checklist every single flight. Not because they forgot how to fly, but because they don't trust their own memory under pressure. So no matter what level of expertise you're at, you can use checklists to become more effective. The three checklists I love making in my life, to-do list, the two want list, and to be list. The to-do list is about execution. The two want list is about expansion and the tob list is about personal evolution. These checklists aren't about creating bureaucracy. They are about creating bandwidth for your brain so it can focus on what must be done on the hard things. If your craft matters to you and if your career matters to you and you take pride in doing hard things, [music] then the easiest way to keep track of what you want to do is your checklist. But even with the simplest system like checklist, there is still one problem. What happens if your brain tries to bypass the system entirely? Which brings me to principle number five. You have to become the system. I've seen great musicians and great leaders and great spiritual masters and they all have this one thing in common. Harvard researchers scanned the brains of Tibetan monks during their meditation sessions and they found that all the monks had their brain waves [music] synchronized with each other across all the individuals perfectly in rhythm. Now these monks weren't trying to focus or they weren't trying to motivate themselves and they were obviously not trying to synchronize their brain waves but their nervous system over time had evolved into developing that pattern. Years of repetition had given rise to this beautiful resonance and they didn't need motivation to do it. So what's the secret that these monks can teach us? Motivation doesn't drive repetition. Repetition drives motivation. When your brain can predict the cadence, it starts craving the queue. Over time, you [music] don't have to push yourself every day. Your biology starts to pull you forward. That's how your brain lights up and [music] that's how you become the person who does the hard things over and over again. But it almost seems effortless. Now it is not effortless. [music] That's just a myth. When you see someone like Raja Federer doing that perfect serve, it seems effortless. But he has put in thousands and thousands and thousands of reps over countless years, day after day, night after night. But our brain over time starts following those patterns. And once the pattern takes over, your brain stops chasing the reward. It starts craving the repetition itself. So tonight, don't just try to change your entire life. Design one tiny rule that changes your tomorrow. Build the right systems and those systems will build the right you.

      "hook_full_transcript": "When you look at the best in the world, Formula 1 drivers, Olympic swimmers, elite athletes, you might think they're superhuman, but they're not. They've simply learned how to consistently access what we call peak performance. So, what does that actually mean? Peak performance is when your mind and body are fully aligned. When your energy, focus, and actions are optimized so you can operate at your absolute best. Not just once in a while, but over and over again. Let me explain how. Here's something people don't realize. Peak performance doesn't start with mindset or motivation or even habits. It starts with biology. Because the truth is, you cannot outperform your body. If your energy is drained, nothing else matters. You can have the best strategies in the world, but if you're running on 10% battery, you'll still struggle. There are four pillars of energy you must master. Let's go through them one by one. Pillar one, sleep. Sleep is not just recovery, it's performance preparation. Studies show that just one night of poor sleep can impair reaction time, memory, and decision-making to the same level as being legally drunk. That's not laziness. That's biology shutting down. So, if you want to operate at your best, treat sleep like a meeting with your future self. Consistent bedtime, dark, cool room, no screens an hour before bed. Pillar two, nutrition. Now, let's go deeper here. Food isn't just fuel. It's programming. Every bite you take is a message to your body. Sugary snacks tell your system to spike and crash. Whole foods tell your brain, \"Stay sharp. Stay steady. Think of it this way. Do you think an Olympic sprinter fuels up with soda and candy before stepping onto the track? Of course not. Yet, most people expect elite performance while living on fast food. Shift your nutrition and you shift your mind. Pillar three, movement. This isn't about becoming an athlete. It's about activating your biology. Movement literally changes your brain chemistry. Just 20 minutes of moderate exercise increases dopamine, serotonin, and BDNF, a protein that supports learning and memory. In plain English, movement makes you smarter and happier. And here's the key, it doesn't have to be extreme. A morning walk, a set of push-ups between work sessions, even stretching resets your system. Your brain is not designed to sit still all day. Pillar four, mental rest. Most people sabotage themselves here. Your brain is not meant to be on 24/7. Constant stimulation, scrolling, notifications, multitasking fries your focus. You need white space, breaks, even boredom. That's why your best ideas often come in the shower or on a quiet walk. Your brain finally has space to connect dots. The point is simple. If you manage your energy, everything else becomes easier. If you ignore it, everything else becomes impossible. But having energy isn't enough. What separates the average from the exceptional is not just having energy, it's knowing where to direct it. And that's where the next piece comes in. Focus. Imagine this. Two people work for the same eight hours. One spends the day bouncing between emails, Slack messages, Tik Tok, and a dozen half-finished tasks. The other spends three blocks of 90 minutes in deep, uninterrupted work. At the end of the day, who really made progress? The answer is obvious. And yet, most people live like the first person. Busy, but not effective. Here's why. Every time you switch tasks, your brain incurs what's called a switching cost. Research shows it can take up to 23 minutes to fully regain deep focus after even a small distraction. That means if you check your phone five times an hour, you're never actually reaching your peak mental performance. Focus is rare. And because it's rare, it's a superpower. Here's how to build it. Step one, eliminate distractions before you start. Don't trust yourself. Put your phone in another room. Use app blockers. Close every tab that's not directly tied to your task. Step two, commit to one thing only, not three, not five, just one. Ask yourself, if I only accomplished this today, would it still be a successful day? That's your task. Step three, use focus blocks. I recommend the 90minute method. Set a timer, dive deep, no interruptions. When the timer ends, take a real break, walk, stretch, reset, then go again. And here's the beauty. The more you do this, the easier it becomes. Focus is a muscle. The first week might feel impossible. By week three, you'll crave it. And when you taste it, the deep flow, the effortless productivity, you'll never want to go back to surface level busyness again. But here's the truth. Even if you master focus, there's still a trap. Because if you don't see yourself as the kind of person who performs at a high level, you'll always self-sabotage. And that brings us to the third key. Most people think peak performance is about goals. They say, \"Once I achieve this, then I'll become the kind of person I want to be.\" But that's backwards. High performers don't start with goals. They start with identity. Formula 1 drivers don't wake up and say, \"I want to drive fast today.\" They live as racers, their training, their nutrition, even the way they think. It all flows from the identity of being a driver. That's why they can perform at such an elite level under pressure. It's not something they try to switch on. It's who they are by default. The same principle applies to you. They don't say, \"I want to run a marathon.\" They say, \"I'm a runner.\" They don't say, \"I want to build a business.\" They say, \"I'm an entrepreneur.\" Here's why this matters. Your brain craves consistency. If your identity is I'm just someone who tries to work out, then every workout feels like a battle. But if your identity is I'm an athlete, working out isn't something you try to do. It's simply what you do. Here's a practical way to reframe. Instead of asking, what do I want to achieve? Ask who is the type of person that achieves this. Then start living as that person immediately, even in small ways. Want to be a writer? Write one page a day. Want to be productive? Ask yourself in each moment, what would a focused person do here? Over time, these small identity based actions compound. Habits stick because they match who you believe you are. And once your identity shifts, peak performance stops being forced. It becomes natural. But even if you master identity, focus, and energy, there's still one more dangerous belief that quietly holds people back. And it's the idea that motivation is what drives success. Let's break that myth right now. Here's the truth. Motivation is the biggest scam in self-improvement. We're told to wait until we feel inspired. But think about it. If your entire success depends on how you feel in the moment, you'll never be consistent. Some days you'll be on fire. Most days you won't. Motivation is like the weather. It changes constantly. Performance can't depend on something so unstable. The highest performers in the world don't rely on motivation. They rely on systems and structure. Think about Michael Phelps. At his peak, he swam 6 days a week, training around 50 mi weekly. Do you really think he felt motivated every single morning at 5:00 a.m.? No. He didn't need to. He had a system. Wake up, swim, eat, rest, repeat. Choice was removed. Resistance disappeared. And this is the secret. You don't need to feel like doing something to do it. You just need to make doing it the default. Practical examples. Don't rely on willpower to eat well. Don't keep junk food in your house. Don't rely on discipline to work. Block distractions in advance. Don't rely on motivation to exercise. Schedule it like an appointment you can't miss. Once you build systems, action comes first and motivation follows. And that's how you reach peak performance consistently, not occasionally. Even if you master energy, focus, identity, and systems, there's one thing that separates good performers from truly elite ones. The ability to measure, reflect, and adjust. Peak performance isn't static. It's a process. You need a feedback loop to know what's working, what's holding you back, and how to keep improving. Here's how to start. Step one, track your inputs, not just outputs. Most people only care about results. Did I hit my sales target? Did I finish the project? That's important, but it's not the full picture. Track the actions that lead to results. How many focused hours you put in, how consistently you exercised, how well you slept, or how deeply you practiced a skill. Step two, reflect regularly. Set aside a few minutes each day or week to ask yourself what worked, what didn't, what drained my energy, what helped me focus. Writing this down is powerful because it creates awareness, which is the first step toward change. Step three, adjust your systems. Feedback without action is wasted. Use what you learned to tweak your routines, your environment, or your habits. Maybe your morning energy spike is wasted on checking emails. Shift it to deep work. Maybe your workouts feel forced. Reframe them as part of your identity. Small changes compound over time. They reinforce the habits and identity you're building. So, let's recap. First, the energy equation. Sleep, nutrition, movement, and rest are the foundation. Second, focus as a superpower. The ability to go deep on one task separates average from extraordinary. Third, identity over goals. You fall to the level of who you believe you are. So, shift your identity and habits align. Finally, why motivation is useless and how to build a feedback loop. That's the framework for peak performance. But here's the real unlock. To truly live it, you need to enter flow state. That's exactly what I cover in my next video. How to easily enter flow state anytime you"

      "hook_full_transcript": "have you ever felt stuck in a conversation like you've backed yourself into a corner and now you have nothing to say and then you just sit there in awkward silence thinking so hard everyone can hear you probably as someone who used to have really bad anxiety I hated this so I learned three ways that I can get out of these kinds of situations and I want to show them to you and how they really work when I want to meet someone new or make a conversation fun and why sometimes there's absolutely nothing you can do about it oh lord it's good to be here with you Fray we've all been there I certainly have you're at a new workplace or a new class and you find yourself left in the room with someone you only kind of know you introduce each other great now what before I did anything else I focused on trying to be comfortable in that awkward silence and I did slowly because I realized that silence wasn't going to kill me like it would if I was a YouTube video I don't know about you but I can remember a lot of the embarrassing stuff that I did in the past but when I tried to remember times where I was silent and it was awkward it never really stuck with me in my opinion life is too short to be worrying about that awkward silence that happens from time to time but that still doesn't take away from the fact that sometimes conversations got dry or boring I found myself in a lot of dry or boring conversations so I needed a way out of them there's three ways I changed so that conversations flowed better what if I told you that even when I didn't think so there was actually so much to say in response to even the tiniest of sentences sounds crazy right but when you think about it people say things and they don't say the entire thing they don't give a book's worth of context behind their words heck they might not even know entirely what they're talking about so how did I listen to what they said like an English teacher reading a book you get extra points if you guessed it right it's active listening but how and why why not stop the conversation from being boring before it becomes boring the moment I started listening to people with presence and properly I saw that my brain started to ask a lot more questions automatically but what does that look like I caught my hand on Sunday while working on a car when I was paying attention and had some level of genuine interest statements like this had heaps of questions behind them what kind of car is it your car how'd you cut it can I see it do you work on cars on Sunday does that happen often did it hurt now am I saying the secret to conversation was learning about cars yes no if I did nothing knew nothing and didn't want to know anything conversations would be about as dry as a snail on the Utah ass Salt Flat also I probably won't make any friends I didn't waste my time wondering about what I should do I just did things that I found interesting be it cars Sports going on Hikes learning about psychology of course it didn't really hurt to do things that a lot of people like doing but sometimes when I felt like something really resonated with me I did that too so what am I saying to have more fun and interesting conversations I develop my personality using interests yeah for this last point I have a really interesting question what do you think counts as a stupid question was it the one I just asked or was it one I've asked before I personally believe that as long as you're genuinely curious about something and ask it respectfully you're just wanting to learn and in that case no question is stupid because you're being brave and humble enough to want to know more how can wanting to know more be stupid of course we can ask silly questions for the sake of being funny but that's for another time sometimes when I sensor conversations getting a little dry I'd ask questions like how tall are you or do you mow the lawn out of genuine curiosity these might seem like some ridiculous questions but nine times out of 10 people are more than happy to answer these kinds of questions especially about themselves and most of the time they made conversations go in a completely different direction and nearly always led to a fun and interesting topic these things are important because it helped me paint a better picture of them so I can have a conversation go naturally and get to know them better maybe I'd find out that they like basketball or that they've never actually used a lawn mower before who knows there's something really important that I need to talk about I realiz that sometimes no matter what I do this will never work but why not well it's as simple as being comfortable with the fact that sometimes people are not great conversationalists themselves and sometimes maybe they're not even interested in talking so I found it's okay to let go when I needed to maybe it was an uninterested date or someone I just didn't click with at a party it's okay and it's not such a big deal as I might have thought just don't water a dead plan I told myself well that's what I did and it seemed to work for me if you're interested in learning about just a brief crash course about active listening I'd recommend you click on this video or subscribe that would be awesome"

in your day-to-day life I'm going to briefly show you what it is a few ways I did it and the amazing effects it had on my people skills and communication oh lord it's good to be here with you Mr the early 1900s was blessed with the birth of an extremely intelligent man his name was kyl Rogers now this guy's education started started fairly early and that's because I you not he could read before he even started kindergarten his interests changed just a little bit throughout the years but he eventually found what he really wanted to do and that was psychology so he studied and became a psychologist in his early years of psychology he helped out children and developed a non-judgmental and empathetic approach to therapy which was probably because all kids wanted at the time was to be heard now in his journey of psychology K found something that is now common knowledge but had way more power than people originally thought he developed something called person centered therapy and a major part of that was active listening it's probably something you've heard before but it's definitely not what most people think it is Carl found that even when he just listened to his patients in a certain way it had amazing effect so before I show you how I did it I'm going to show what happened when I tried it I thought to myself one day everyone wants to talk about themselves all the time so what might most people feel like when they listen to I mean so few people nowadays are actually heard so most of what they say just goes into the void the most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and to be understood the best way to understand people is to listen to them when I implemented active listening into my social life it made others feel really understood and their feelings validated and there's no feeling like being heard this made the people around me happier and more confident and also really actually listening to someone made them come to conclusions that they wouldn't have by themselves therefore it made them mental health even better but the conversations themselves also got better when I properly listened to someone in a way that made them feel honest and more authentic they said the most random and real I've ever seen and it made for some really fun and interesting conversations that's cool and all but how do we actually know active listening Works to do that we have to take a look at Rogers methods when Rogers practiced his methods clients achieved personal insight and helped themselves healed they felt certain parts of themselves were more accepted and they trusted the list more they felt happier too this is what I want for you so stick around his methods became revolutionary and now active listening is used almost everywhere not just in Psychology like schools businesses communities and obviously therapy and the best part is unlike Chaos Theory or quantum physics this is rather easy to get into and to start learning K well how did I actually do this well active listening is different from ordinary listening you might know of it's not the same as just not talking when you're being spoken to the first step to getting better at listening to people was to actually be there to be present but I also had to learn several tools and skills it was a fairly important distinction to make that these are tools not steps not tips they're tools they're skills that I could learn and apply when I needed to understand someone better it's also important to remember that whenever someone says something there's the content itself and there's em motion behind it a part of active listening involves responding and understanding either of these or even both first I had to make sure that I wasn't losing my marbles allow me to elaborate here I started paraphrasing and summarizing what the other person just said in a very short and natural way and you really find it quite hard to believe that they would really love you if they knew you that's right you know that's exactly it what I would do was I would repeat back what I think I heard in a fairly natural and Casual manner in a way that the other person the speaker would agree with this made it pretty much impossible for any misunder standing to take place it's just kind of loosely making sure that we're both on the same page even Rogers found that he was wrong sometimes happens but there was something just as important that I was missing I needed to gain understanding as they were speaking I needed to encourage them to keep going I mean why would someone keep talking to me if they thought I wasn't even listening doing this was as simple as not staring at the other person as they were talking with no emotion whatsoever I mean it is called active listening for a reason all I had to do was something called minimal encourages which is pretty much just nonverbally communicating to make sure that you're engaged this was a really good way to encourage the other person to continue speaking here's a cheeky example and I'm not positive they'll truly accept me something tells me they will I know they will but I'm not positive personally I don't do it as much as what you just saw it also really helps when I take my time to respond instead of just responding as soon as I possibly can but words don't always say exactly what we're feeling so what about that how can I show empathy while I'm listening how can I work on understanding the feelings of others that's when I found about found about what that's when I found out about something called emotion labeling and that's where after talking with someone for a little bit you practice labeling their emotions in an empathetic matter you might get it wrong and that's okay but it'll have a similar effect anyways and when I tried this I gradually got better I get encouraged when I read in a book from somebody I respect and admire that this is the right thing no matter what honesty went out well then that keeps giving me confidence by gosh I'm right but it's so damn hard to really choose something on your own isn't it which makes me feel very immature I don't like this in me I wish I were all I said was stuff like it sounds like you're having a rough time and I guess you're glad that's over as well as that sounds exciting or you seem happy this helps build an emotional connection with the other person it helps them understand themselves better and they feel better because they hurt this was a bit awkward to do at first but as long as I did it naturally and casually it worked very well this last one was probably the most mind-blowing thing I've ever done to myself it was the simplest way to get better at listening to people but it was also the hardest you can make more friends in 2 months by becoming interested in other people than you can in 2 years by trying to get other people interested in you you've probably heard this quote before but why am i showing it to you well it's mostly because it's spitting facts listening to someone is not the same as wanting to understand them genuinely I realize the value in actually wanting to listen to people and understand them after practicing active listing it got a bit easier and I got a bit better at it because when I took the time to really understand someone I realized just how interesting people can be if we have a number of such experiences however they will shape an attitude which will allow us to be truly genuine in our interests in the speaker this put me on the path of real Charisma now if you like this stuff like me you should probably check out some of my older videos and maybe even stick around for the ones to come if I don't die or something I should be uploading sometime next week"

      "hook_full_transcript": "I had this document open for three weeks, just blank, staring at me every time I opened my laptop. I kept telling myself I'd start writing when I had a better idea, when I felt inspired, when I actually knew what I wanted to say. But that day never came. The document just stayed blank. We do this with everything, don't we? We wait, collect information, watch tutorials, read books, bookmark articles, and tell ourselves we're preparing, but really, we're just scared. Scared it won't be good. Scared we'll look stupid. Scared we'll start and realize we have no idea what we're doing. So, we don't start. We wait for some imaginary version of ourselves who's braver, smarter, more ready. But that person doesn't exist. You know what I realized staring at that blank document? Clarity doesn't come from thinking. It comes from doing. You don't figure out what to write by planning. You figure it out by writing badly and then fixing it. You don't learn to draw by studying anatomy for 6 months. You learn by drawing terrible hands until they stop looking like fleshy spiders. Action creates clarity, not the other way around. And yeah, starting is humiliating. Your first attempt is always worse than you imagined. It's clunky. It doesn't work. You feel like an impostor. But that feeling isn't a sign you shouldn't be doing it. That's just what learning feels like. Every single person who's ever been good at something went through that phase. They just didn't stop. They began anyway. Kirkagard said something I think about a lot. Life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards. You won't understand what you're doing until you've already done it. The path only makes sense when you look back. But we want the understanding first. We want the map before the journey. And because we can't have that, we just stand at the starting line forever. I finally wrote something in that document. It was bad, really bad. But the second I started typing, something shifted. Ideas came. Not because I was ready, but because I was moving. And suddenly the blank page wasn't scary anymore. It was just a page. So maybe that's the whole thing. You don't wait until you're ready. You don't wait until you know what you're doing. You don't wait until the fear goes away. You just begin badly, messily, imperfectly because nothing in your life will change until you do. The book doesn't write itself while you're researching. The business doesn't build itself while you're planning. The skill doesn't develop while you're watching other people do it. You have to start today, right now. Even if it's terrible, especially if it's terrible."

      "hook_full_transcript": "Monkey promised: “Tomorrow will be different.” Monkey set five alarms. Monkey put the phone across the room. Monkey even whispered to himself, “I will wake up early and rule the jungle.” And yet, at sunrise, Monkey is still wrestling his blanket like it’s WWE, while Monkey’s brain feels like mashed bananas. Part 1: The secret behind mornings. Mornings don’t actually begin in the morning. They begin the night before. Monkey’s evening is the charging cable for Monkey’s brain. If Monkey spends it on Nextflix and chips until 3 a.m., Monkey wakes up at 20%. But with the right evening routine, Monkey wakes up like a fully charged jungle king. Part two: Banana smoothie brain science. At night, Monkey’s brain is basically a banana smoothie. Whatever goes in before bed is the flavor Monkey wakes up with. TikTok drama in, distraction-flavored brain. Peaceful routine in, clarity-flavored brain. Cortisol is supposed to rise in the morning to wake Monkey up. Stay up late? Curve scrambled. Monkey ends up groggy. Dopamine resets during sleep. Feed it chaos, chaos gets wired in. Feed it calm, focus gets wired in. Monkey’s brain is a smoothie maker. Garbage in, garbage morning. Calm in, sharp morning. Part three: Framework — six-step evening routine. Step one: Banana trigger. Monkey had a problem. Morning routines? Easy. Monkey wakes up and starts. But evenings? Trickier. Monkey gets distracted — Nextflix, social media, or chatting with another Monkey. So Monkey needed a signal to start the night routine. Monkey’s room lights turn banana-red at 9 p.m. Red is not party time. Red is bedtime countdown. Monkey sets a nightly alarm labeled “Banana Trigger.” Do Not Disturb and app limits turn on after 9. Relying on willpower is like relying on a peeled banana to hold shape — it collapses fast. Monkey needed a system. Step two: Digital sunset. Blue light tricks Monkey’s brain into thinking it’s noon. So Monkey created a digital sunset: Monkey shuts down the screens. No doomscrolling one hour before bed. Monkey even tried hiding the phone in a banana box. Problem? Monkey was the one who hid it, so of course Monkey found it. That’s why Monkey turned it into a rule, not a bedtime wish. Step three: Bathroom ritual. Monkey learned: don’t wait until Monkey is sleepy to wash Monkey’s face or brush Monkey’s teeth. Do it early in the routine. Because nothing kills sleepy vibes like ice-cold water slapping Monkey’s face at midnight. Step four: Journaling — banana dump & tomorrow’s domino. Monkey’s brain at night is like jungle radio. Work deadline. Random bill. That text Monkey regrets. Maybe even starting a banana business at 2 a.m. If Monkey tries to sleep like that, Monkey tosses around like a blender full of coconuts. So Monkey grabs a banana notebook and writes everything down: Three good things. Three lessons. What could be better. Once dumped, the thoughts stop bouncing in Monkey’s skull. Jungle radio off. Monkey used to plan tomorrow like writing an encyclopedia — twenty tasks, zero completed. Now Monkey chooses one domino task — one main task. Knock it down, and tomorrow already feels like a win. Step five: Tea & banana book. Instead of a midnight jungle rave, Monkey brews chamomile tea. Zero caffeine, just calm jungle vibes. Maybe a spoon of honey. With tea in hand, Monkey opens a banana book. Minimum twenty minutes. Science, stories, or wisdom to fuel tomorrow. If Monkey starts rereading the same sentence five times, that’s not studying — that’s the sleep fairy knocking on Monkey’s skull. Time to close the book. Step six: Physical cool-down & environment reset. If Monkey still isn’t sleepy, Monkey’s body needs signals: “Yo, it’s sleep time.” A quick stretch. Some deep breathing. Maybe a warm shower an hour before bed. Then cool room mode. Room temperature 15 to 20° C. If it's too hot, monkey sweats like fried bananas. Too cold, monkeys and ice banana pop. Find the sweet spot. Environment matters, too. Messy room, messy Monkey brain. Clear the banana chaos, morning feels like stepping onto a fresh jungle path instead of slipping on a peel. Finally, a glass of water by the bed. Future monkey wakes up, rehydrates instantly. Smooth. Part four: Identity shift and outro. This wasn’t just about sleep. Monkey wasn’t just going to bed earlier. Monkey became the kind of Monkey who designs tomorrow before it even starts. While most Monkeys fell asleep to TokTik drama, this Monkey was stacking wins that compound into the future. Tomorrow starts tonight. So, what’s the one habit that makes your nights calm and your mornings easy? Drop it in the comments. The Monkey says: “Thanks. Like this video. Toss Monkey a subscribe — it keeps the bananas coming.”"

Monkey can binge an entire Nextflix season and call it just one more episode. But ask Monkey to sit down and study for 30 minutes. Suddenly, Monkey acts like he's being tortured in the banana mines and starting a side project. Monkey promises to work for an hour, but 5 minutes later, he's already sneaking toward the fridge, pretending cleaning counts as productivity. Here's the paradox: Monkey actually knows deep down that studying, exercising, or even cleaning his room would bring long-term rewards, but Monkey still prefers the quick hits, video games, social media, TV. Why is that? Why do some monkeys out there seem motivated to tackle hard stuff every single day while this monkey would rather nap? And the big question is: Is there a way to trick monkey brain into liking hard things? Part one, dopamine. The answer starts with a tiny chemical inside Monkey’s brain: dopamine. People often call dopamine the pleasure molecule. But that's not quite right. Dopamine doesn't make Monkey feel pleasure — it makes monkey want. It's the craving chemical. Dopamine is the invisible banana dangling in front of Monkey's face. Monkey hasn't even eaten the banana yet, but the mere thought of it gets him running. Part two, rat experiments. To understand how powerful dopamine is, let's look at monkeys distant cousins: the lab rats. Scientists once gave rats a lever. Every time a rat pressed the lever, electrodes zapped their brain's reward system with dopamine. The result? Rats went bananas. They pressed the lever over and over for hours, forgetting to eat, forgetting to sleep — some literally pressed until they collapsed. Then scientists tried the opposite. They blocked dopamine in the rats brains. The same rats suddenly became so lazy they wouldn't even get up for food or water. They weren't depressed. If food was placed directly in their mouths, they still chewed happily, but they had zero motivation to move for it. Here's the scary part: Monkey's brain works the same way. Dopamine isn't about enjoying bananas. It's about motivating monkey to chase them. Part three, dopamine tolerance. Monkey's brain has a rule called homeostasis. It always tries to stay balanced. Too hot? Monkey sweats to cool down. Too cold? Monkey shivers to warm up. Same with dopamine. When Monkey floods his brain with video games, junk food, endless scrolling,... the brain adapts. It dials down dopamine receptors. Just like a drinker who needs more alcohol to feel tipsy, Monkey needs bigger dopamine hits just to feel normal. It's like eating candy bananas at a five-star buffet every single day. But soon, if someone hands Monkey a plain banana, Monkey sneers: \"Boring. Where's the caramel drizzle?\". So when Monkey sits down to study, his brain compares: TokTik? Fireworks of dopamine. A textbook? Just one sad sparkler. No wonder studying feels unbearable. Monkey's brain has recalibrated. This is called dopamine tolerance. And it explains why monkey struggles so much with hard things. His brain isn't broken, just spoiled by candy bananas and no longer cares for regular ones. Part four, dopamine detox. Monkey decided to try something radical: a dopamine detox. Picture this. Monkey eats candy bananas at a five-star buffet every day. After a while, a plain banana feels like an insult. But if monkey gets stranded on a deserted island starving, suddenly that same plain banana tastes amazing. That's the logic behind detox. Take away the constant artificial candy bananas so plain bananas like studying or exercising become rewarding again. There are two ways monkey can detox. Number one, radical detox. One whole day, no phone, no internet, no games, no junk food. Monkey sits with boredom. And when boredom hits hard, suddenly writing in a journal or reading a book feels fun. Number two, light detox. Once a week, monkey avoids one high dopamine behavior. Maybe no social media on Sundays. Maybe no video games on Wednesdays. It's like a mini reset. The point isn't to punish Monkey. It's to reset Monkey's brain. Lower the tolerance. Make plain bananas taste sweet again. Part five, reward system. Monkey knew he couldn't detox forever. Bananas are fun, after all. So, he built a system: Work first, reward after. If monkey eats the candy banana first thing, like scrolling Fakebook in bed — forget about studying after. Motivation gone. Instead, Monkey must flip the script: Work first, bananas later. Example, one hour of study earns Monkey 15 minutes of his favorite snack time. And after eight hours of work, Monkey gets two hours of guilt-free fun. The key? Monkey must never reward himself before the work. The banana only comes after. Part six, five tricks to outsmart monkey brain. Now that Monkey's dopamine levels are reset, monkey can also use a few clever hacks to make work feel less painful. Number one, gamification. Monkey loves games, so turn work into one. Make tasks into\" levels\". Earn banana points. Keep a checklist. Every small victory earns Monkey a banana coin. Number two, start small. Monkey hates climbing mountains, but Monkey doesn't mind one small step. Trick: Monkey says, \"Just do it for 2 minutes\". Once Monkey starts, momentum kicks in and he usually keeps going. Number three, instant bananas. Monkey thrives on quick rewards. So after finishing a task, give him a mini banana. One page written? Eat a snack. 20 push-ups? Watch TV. Small wins keep Monkey hooked. Number four, monkey squad. Monkey alone is lazy. But monkey in a squad? Motivated. When monkey studies with friends or works with a group, he suddenly doesn't want to look like the slacker of the troop. Accountability works wonders. Number five, identity shift. Monkey acts according to identity. If monkey says, \"I'm lazy,\" he stays lazy. If monkey says, \"I'm disciplined,\" he starts behaving that way. Behavior follows belief. Part seven, the choice of bananas. At the end of the day, dopamine isn't the enemy. It's the reason monkey builds, creates, and survives. The question is: where does monkey get his dopamine? From endless scrolling and other candy banana habits or from growth, learning, and real progress. Monkey doesn't need to kill dopamine. Monkey just needs to crave the right bananas. Monkey doesn't naturally like hard things. But with detox, smart rewards, and a few tricks. Hard things stop feeling like torture. So the next time monkey stares at a to-do list, monkey remembers. It's not about forcing discipline. It's about outsmarting Monkey’s brain. The only question is: Which bananas will monkey choose? The monkey says thanks. Like this video. Toss him a subscribe. It keeps the bananas coming. [Music]"

      "hook_full_transcript": "Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories. The first story is about connecting the dots. I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a dropin for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why' I drop out? It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young unwed graduate student and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates. So everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife except that when I popped out, they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking, \"We've got an unexpected baby boy. Do you want him? They said, \"Of course.\" My biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college. This was the start in my life. And 17 years later, I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford. And all of my workingclass parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After 6 months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all the money my parents had saved their entire life. So, I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out okay. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back, it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out, I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting. It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor and friends rooms. I returned coke bottles for the 5-cent deposits to buy food with. And I would walk the seven miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hari Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example. Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus, every poster, every label on every drawer was beautifully handcalliggraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and sand serif type faces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture and I found it fascinating. None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But 10 years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me and we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple type faces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them. [Music] If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on that calligraphy class. And personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course, it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college, but it was very, very clear looking backwards 10 years later. Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backwards. So, you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something, your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well-worn path and that will make all the difference. My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky. I found what I love to do early in life. W and I started Apple in my parents' garage when I was 20. We worked hard and in 10 years, Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4,000 employees. We just released our finest creation, the Macintosh, a year earlier, and I just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew, we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me. And for the first year or so, things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our board of directors sided with him. And so at 30, I was out and very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone and it was devastating. I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down, that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noise and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me. I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I'd been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over. I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life. During the next 5 years, I started a company named Next, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the world's first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought Next, and I returned to Apple. And the technology we developed at Next is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance. And Loren and I have a wonderful family together. I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life's going to hit you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life. And the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking and don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking. Don't settle. My third story is about death. When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like, \"If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right.\" It made an impression on me. And since then, for the past 33 years, I've looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself, if today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today? And whenever the answer has been no for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something. Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything, all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure, these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. About a year ago, I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn't even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable and that I should expect to live no longer than 3 to 6 months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die. It means to try and tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes. I live with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening, I had a biopsy where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach, and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas, and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife who was there told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope, the doctor started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and thankfully I'm fine now. [Applause] This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept. No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet, death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be because death is very likely the single best invention of life. It's life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now, the new is you. But someday, not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it's quite true. Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary. When I was young, there was an amazing publication called the Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the Bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stuart Brand not far from here in Menllo Park. And he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late60s before personal computers and desktop publishing. So, it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and Polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form 35 years before Google came along. It was idealistic, overflowing with neat tools and great notions. Stuart and his team put out several issues of the Whole Earth catalog. And then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid 1970s and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words, \"Stay hungry, stay foolish.\" It was their farewell message as they signed off, \"Stay hungry, stay foolish.\" And I have always wished that for myself. And now as you graduate to begin a new, I wish that for you. Stay hungry. Stay foolish. Thank you all very much."

The thing that made hobbies special was that they were the one area of your life where you could be terrible at something and it didn't matter. where you could experiment, mess up, try weird stuff, and there were no consequences because it was just for you. Now we're tracking our progress, setting goals, comparing ourselves to others online, treating our free time like it's another job we're not getting paid for. We've infected our downtime with the same productivity mindset that already dominates everything else. I see this constantly with creative stuff. Someone starts making beats because they think it might be fun, but within a week they're watching YouTube tutorials on the producer mindset and building your brand as a beat maker. They haven't even finished their first track and they're already thinking about Soundcloud followers and getting signed to a label or painting. People download Procreate to mess around with digital art, but suddenly they're researching brush settings and watching speed paint tutorials and feeling frustrated because their stuff doesn't look like what they see online. The experimentation phase gets skipped entirely. Social media obviously makes this worse. Everything becomes content. You can't just skateboard for the feeling of it. You should probably be filming tricks for Tik Tok. You can't just produce music for yourself. Why not post those beats on Instagram? The act of documenting the hobby becomes more important than actually enjoying the hobby. And then there's the productivity guilt. We live in a culture where rest feels irresponsible. If you're not hustling, grinding, building something, what are you even doing? Hobbies feel frivolous because they don't directly contribute to your career or your bank account or your personal development. But that's exactly the point. Hobbies aren't supposed to be productive. They're supposed to be the antidote to productivity culture, not another victim of it. When you make music just because certain sounds make you happy. When you paint just to see colors mixed together. When you skateboard just to feel the movement, that's not wasted time. That's your brain getting to play. That's you remembering what it feels like to be human instead of a productivity machine. We've convinced ourselves that if something doesn't lead somewhere, it's pointless. But what if the point is just the doing? What if the value is in the experience itself, not in any outcome or product you might create? We've made everything into a potential side hustle. Every interest has to be justified through productivity or profit. But when every hobby becomes a business opportunity, we lose something essential about what makes them valuable in the first place. Your hobbies don't owe you anything. They don't have to make you money or make you better or make you more interesting. Sometimes the most radical thing you can do is just enjoy something for the sake of enjoying"

Sure, if you learned a hard enough language it would probably, impress a lot of strangers and it would probably get you a lot of views on Youtube. subscribers too. I think some people even make money from it. But if you’re a beginner, you should really be picking a language that’s easy enough for you to actually enjoy learning it. You shouldn't pick a language if you're gonna treat it like a chore. So to maximize your chances of success, here’s a chart of some popular languages ranked by how much time it takes for an English speaker to learn them. If you're not sure what language you should start learning, I would just pick either Spanish, French, or Portuguese. Not only are they the easiest for English speakers, but many countries speak one of these as an official language. I don’t know why. but it’s probably just a weird coincidence. However if you do want to go for a harder language, it is possible. Just remember to ask yourself, do I really have the right motivation? For example. “wanting to understand anime” is not gonna motivate you to learn Japanese for more than a day. However, “My friends speak Spanish and I want to understand them” is a pretty good motivator, because that’s probably why they made a group chat without you. Some people have a take a language class for school. But that by itself is not a great motivator because your finger might slip and you might accidentally paste all your assignments into DeepL. However, The British invaded my country and I need English to survive, is the perfect motivation to start learning English, and so far it seems to have been a huge success. So now that you’ve picked your language, it’s time for the easy part, which is learning it. Usually, people on the internet will tell you that the fastest method to learn any language is to get a language partner, or a tutor, or a friend who’s willing to sit down with you, and talk to you like a baby, until you start picking up words and sentences. And while this is probably the fastest way, it requires human interaction. So instead here’s a method that you can do all by yourself, at home, to become fluent in a language. The first step, is learning the basics. This is actually a very easy step, but many people try to skip it by doing one or two Duolingo lessons . Other people get stuck on the language-learning side of youtube, watching 138 videos about how to Learn Korean, none of which include a single word of Korean. But the whole time, all you really had to do was find a beginner textbook for that language that has practice exercises for you to do. It might take you a month to finish the whole thing, but the progress you’ll make is equal to about 2 years of Duolingo, or about 12 years of school in America. ,and you can find these books for free by just googling “beginner, then the language, textbook pdf.” And there you go. You could also get them from the library. Or, as they say in France, Once you finish the beginner book, it’s time to practice listening. You don’t even have to worry about speaking right now, because first you need to learn what the language is actually supposed to sound like. The easiest way to do this, is by watching youtube videos in that language. The idea behind this, is that you’re not gonna understand everything, but by looking at the video, and using context clues from what you do understand, you can slowly pick up the language without even realizing. This works especially well because every language only has a few thousand words that are actually used in regular conversation. So overtime, you’ll start recognizing the same few words and phrases in every video you watch. And you can really pick anything to watch, as long as it’s interesting, and you can understand at least 30% of it. If you put on a video and it sounds like gibberish, it’s not your fault, they’re just talking too fast. this is probably because they’re trying to gatekeep their language. Do not let them do this. To fix it, just go to the Youtube search bar, and add the magic word “easy”, and just like that, you get served up a bunch of videos that you can understand. Automatic captions also help a lot, cause you can rewind and look up the words you don't know. There are even websites like reversocontext where you can look up a word or phrase and actually see it used in a real sentence. But whatever you do, do not turn on english subtitles. IF YOU'RE READING THIS...I KNOW YOU HAVE THEM ON Many people who try to learn Japanese, for example, watch anime. This is not a bad way to learn Japanese. But people who turn on English subtitles, will just read the subtitles, and even though they think they’re learning Japanese, in 5 years, all they’ll have to show for it is this profile picture and a discord nitro subscription. But luckily, you’ve been using subtitles in the right language, and you can now understand at least 70% of everything you watch. It’s time to unleash step 3, which is speaking practice. to start speaking, just keep watching youtube, except now, you pause after each important sentence, and repeat it out loud. Or at least whisper it. Try to pretend like you’re having a real conversation with an actual person. And even think of different possible situations where you could use the sentence. Whenever you find a sentence that sounds really useful, write it down in a notebook. You're probably never gonna look at that notebook ever again, but it's nice to get some writing practice. Now, at any point in this entire process, once you feel ready to start speaking, sit down and record yourself talking to a camera. And just talk about your day, stuff you did, stuff you’re looking forward to, and even ask a couple questions to the imaginary person on the other side. If you ever forget how to say something, fill it in with english and move on. Later, you can watch the recording back, and look up whatever you didn’t know how to say using DeepL or reverso context. To an outsider, this might look like a lonely way to learn a language, but if you’ve ever heard someone say they’re self-taught, this is exactly what they were doing. And that’s all there is to it, if you keep reading about the language, watching youtube and talking to a camera for long enough you’ll become fluent without ever having to talk to an actual person. Congratulations. But one day in the future, you’ll probably have to travel, and you’ll eventually have to talk to native speakers. All you have to do is just learn the culture and keep up with the politics. For example, if you ever visit France, this is what you might expect to see, but what you’ll actually see is hundreds of French farmers driving their tractors into the capital to form a blockade. If you stop a Frenchman on the street to ask what happened, he’ll just tell you that this is just a normal day in France. French people use creative protest as a way to pass the time, and you clearly must’ve not read about it using Ground News. #sponsored. Ground News is an app, and a website, that feeds you news from multiple sources while also telling you straight-up if the sources reporting on an article, are biased. For example, When I'm reading that BBC article about how French farmers are protesting getting absolutely shafted by the government, the Ground News browser extension shows that this article is from the center, and the left and the right seem to be covering it pretty equally. If you click on Full Coverage, you can see that 306 sources are covering this story, and there’s a summary from each political viewpoint. The Bias insights feature tells you how the left, right, and center, are reporting on the story differently. You can even see tabs showing bias distribution, the factuality of the sources, and who owns them. But what I do most often, is compare headlines. This article makes the protestors look like angry manure-slinging traffic-blockers, while this article makes them look like strong, revolutionary heroes.

      "hook_full_transcript": "People usally think losing weight is about half diet and half excercise, but both of those combined are only about 25% of it, Another 25% is good quality sleep, and the other--500 percent—is actually doing what you said you would.

There's always a spark that makes you decide you wanna change, and it’s usually seeing someone else who’s way more fit than you, or seeing yourself in a picture. Either way, inspiration is strong, but only ever lasts for a day, and then it’s gone. So what you need next, is a realistic goal that you can measure, as well as a time you need to achieve it by. For example, “I’m going to lose 5 pounds by July 1st, and another 5 pounds by August 1st” is something you can measure, and it even has a checkpoint to keep you motivated. Then the next thing you need is a detailed and realistic plan that will get you to your goal. The plan might just be to replace your daily breakfast of milk, sugary granola and a peanut butter jelly sandwich, with instead a 1-mile jog, followed by a bowl of 15 big strawberries and 3 boiled eggs,. Believe it or not, this one change is more than enough for you to lose multiple pounds of fat in just a few weeks. But having the plan is not enough. You need to set everything up, so that you can easily follow the plan. You have to buy the strawberries, and boil the eggs the night before, and get your running clothes ready, so that when you wake up, the easiest thing to do is just stick to the plan. If you don’t boil the eggs, and you keep buying peanut butter and grape jelly and you keep putting them at the front of the fridge where it's the first thing you see, than that means you don't actually intend to stick to your diet. You’re just looking forward to that one day when you give in and make your high calorie breakfast again. If you want to make it easy to eat healthy, then make it hard to eat junk food. Of course, that’s easy to say, but no matter how much you try to avoid even looking at junk food, you need to expect that there will be hard times. Like when you accidentally trip and fall face first into a booth at IHOP, you see that every item is over a thousand calories, and you get the temptation to say five of the most dangerous words in diet history. You can pick from any of the following options. A. “One cheat meal won’t hurt” B. “I’ll *actually* start dieting tomorrow” ←never do this C. “I just won’t eat later” D. “Maybe I’ll just start bulking” And its times like this when you need willpower. Which is the ability to tell yourself no. You can build up your willpower by anticipating all the excuses you’re gonna make, and practicing saying no to all of them. You can even practice walking away from bad choices. But keep in mind that willpower isn’t infinite, so you can’t always rely on it. You're better off just avoiding the temptation in the first place. Finally, the real cheat code to motivation, is doing something for so long that it becomes a habit. If you can get to the point where you wake up and automatically go outside for a jog, and you automatically reach for the strawberries and boiled eggs, then the plan becomes a hundred times easier to follow, and it'll keep getting easier every day you do it. Eventually, you might even start to **like** eating healthy and excercising, at which point, like for many other people, it’s no longer a lifestyle choice, but instead, your entire personality. And this is the ultimate goal. Anyway, let's move on to the basics of fat loss. There’s no real accurate way to track it besides progress pictures, and weighing yourself once a week. For the progress pictures, just know that you won’t see much change in the first few weeks, and maybe not even in the first few months, because your body first prioritizes losing fat from places that you probably can’t see. But once you start seeing visual progress, it starts to become more and more noticeable very quickly. So to *really* measure your progress, you should step on a scale maybe once every morning. Just know that it can fluctuate a lot based on water weight, or the types of foods you eat. Which means, you might lose a pound of fat, but your weight might not change right away. So instead of looking at your day-to-day progress, just look at your average week-to-week progress. So you’ve probably heard that to lose fat over time, you have to eat less calories than you burn. That means if your body burns 2000 calories a day, then eating 1700 calories a day will make you lose fat. That’s because the body will use energy from fat. and a teeny tiny bit of muscle to help cover the 300 calorie defecit. And if you drop your calories even lower, to 1500 or even 1200 a day, you’ll lose fat more quickly, but at the expense of it being way more difficult for you to maintain. The traditional, optimal way to figure out how many calories you should be eating is to use a online calorie calculator. Activity level sedentary....why lie, And then eat around this number, every day, as a starting point to lose weight. But it’s worth noting that this number can be way off since everyone has a different metabolism. And it can be especially off for people with hormonal problems. high cortisol, low estrogen/testosterone, low thyroid hormones So the best way to know for sure is to start with this number, and then see how your weight changes over the next few weeks. If you find that each week, your weight is not changing, then you need to lower your daily calories by another 200-300. And if you ever reach a point where you haven’t lost any weight for at least a week, you’ll either need to reduce your calories again, or you could also just add in some more excercise. Now for some people, this method works perfectly because in theory, you can’t go wrong with it. The only problem is, you have to count exactly how many calories you eat per day, using nutrition labels, calorie counting apps, mental math, and also food scales, which measure exactly how much of each food you’re eating in grams. If you’re American, you might not be familiar with the metric system, but you don’t have to worry, since the McDonald’s menu already has calorie counts. Anyway, you can also get away with just roughly estimating your calories, but this only really works if you play it safe and round everything up like crazy. if you think it’s 300 calories it’s probably 500, if you think it’s 800 calories, it’s probably 1000. And if you think it’s too small to count, it’s probably at least 50. So before we get into the method where you don’t have to track anything at all, we need to talk about macronutrients. Whether you track them or not, a lot of people want to know how much protein, carbs, and fat they should eat per day. And to be honest, for most weight loss purposes, all you need to look at is calories and protein. You need a certain amount of protein, a certain amount of fats, and then you can fill in the rest of your calories with anything. Just make sure for fats, not to overeat stuff like oil, sauces, salad dressings, butter, nuts, and cheese. Because even though these are healthy in moderate amounts, fats have 9 calories per gram, which means one pack of trail mix has about 3 times the calories of a dying neutron star. Also, if you’ve ever heard weight loss experts say that carbs cause weight gain, they’re not talking about fruits and vegetables and fiber and whole grains. They’re talking about refined, highly processed carbs that are usually very delicious and are stripped of most, if not all of their nutrients when they’re being processed. Especially foods with lots of added sugars. Here are some examples. *Did you catch that, subtitle reader? You’ll notice that this is basically the entire grocery store. The problem with these is that they’re unnaturally delicious, easy to overeat, they have lots of calories, and they just end up making you hungrier. Of course, you can still have them everyday, and you’ll still lose weight if you’re in a calorie deficit. Which is why some people like to brag about how they can eat a family size box of reeses puffs every day and still lose weight. What they don’t tell you is that they have an empty void in their stomach for 23 hours a day, their bloodwork comes back with just a giant crying emoji, and simply adding milk to their cereal takes them out of a calorie deficit, so they have use water. And that brings us to the method how to lose fat without counting calories. The Number One trick is to just start slowly eating more minimally processed foods, avoiding junk, chips, sugary desserts, stuff with lots of refined carbs, and instead swapping that out for fruits, vegetables, lean dairy, lean protein, healthy fats, and whole grains. You’ll find that these foods are so filling and nutritious that you can eat in a calorie deficit every single day without having to feel that hungry. If you don’t believe me, this is 200 calories of oreos, and this is 200 calories of strawberries. Another tip is to just stop snacking, and only eat during meals. It’s ok to snack on fruits and vegetables, and maybe even some low-calorie diet snacks like these if you really get cravings, but most people snack on high calorie, tasty junk food, because they’re bored, stressed, or thirsty, not cause they’re hungry. So cutting out snacks is actually one of the easiest things you can do, since the body doesn’t really need them anyway. And overtime, you’ll just stop getting the urge to snack. Ideally, once this happens, you’ll start to slowly develop a feeling of “i’m better than everyone else,” which should be enough to keep you going till the end of your diet. But in case times get hard, here are some more tips. Number 1: start drinking lots of water. Water is very filling and half of the time, when you’re hungry, a quick drink of water will get rid of the feeling. Just keep a big water bottle next to you and you’ll never forget. This will also prevent you from craving high calorie drinks like soda, juice, bubble tea, and milkshakes. Number 2: If you keep saying, \"The real diet starts tomorrow!\" Then it'll never start. Number 3: avoid liquid calories! It’s way easier to drink lots of calories in the form of sugary drinks than it is to eat them. Number 4: Low-fat shredded cheese, keto bread, cauliflower rice, eggwhites, and even peanut butter powder are low-calorie swaps you can make. Number 5: you can make healthy meals like this and this taste good with 0-calorie condiments and spices and sauces and 0-calorie sweeteners. But don’t overuse them because in general, the tastier your food is, the more cravings you’ll get for tasty food. Number 6: Use zero-calorie diet sodas to your advantage, if you have sweet cravings. Number 7: eat high volume, high fiber foods that fill up your stomach but are low calorie. number 8: eat around 3 to 5 meals a day, since it helps you avoid long periods of feeling hungry, and it’s usually easy to fit into your lifestyle. 1 big meal a day might also work, but people tend to give up on that diet very quickly. number 9: save your biggest meals for times when you tend to get the hungriest. number 10: Many people find it easy to be in a calorie deficit when doing intermittent fasting. It involves only giving yourself a 4 to 8 hour window to eat, and then not eating the rest of the day. It might sound hard, but just know that when you don’t eat, you won’t just be constantly hungry. Hunger comes and goes in waves. So If you just wait a little bit, the hunger goes away. number 11: eat more protein, because protein makes you feel satisfied, and you also burn about 20 calories just to digest 100 calories of protein. number 12: Speaking of protein, protein powder is good, but it’s processed, and it’s a powder that you drink, so it’s not really as filling as other protein sources. But if you need it to meet your protein requirements, then drink it with water. number 13: If you want to, try black coffee, or tea, since caffeine, slightly boosts your metabolism, and slightly suppresses your appetite. number 14: - use smaller plates, smaller bowls, and smaller portion sizes, because it tricks you into feeling full quickly. number 15: - if you mess up, don’t take it as an excuse to start eating tons of junk food.Because even though messing up wasn’t part of the plan, giving up was never part of the plan. Now onto exercise. it burns some calories, it improves your health, and once you experience what it really takes to burn 200 calories, you’re probably less likely to pop open a 200-calorie bag of chips. So here are some tips: number 1) lift weights. This will not only increase your metabolism, but it also burns calories and helps you build muscle. You can use this website to get ideas for exercises. number 2) go on more walks. Getting at least 10,000 steps a day is basically a cheat code for burning extra calories and losing fat. number 3) do more cardio. While diet is more important than exercise for losing fat, cardio will make it easier. If you find it boring, you can try high intensity interval training, or if you like, you can do circuit style workouts, which you can find lots of on youtube. Some gym bros like to claim that 15-minute youtube workouts don’t work. But remember that they watch hour-long videos of other people working out, number 4) be less sedentary. not many people talk about this because it’s hard to explain. But getting up and moving around and just doing stuff throughout the day, burns way more calories than you would think. This includes activities that you don't normally think of as exercise, like taking the stairs, cleaning your house, pressure washing your driveway, cooking, fidgeting, standing, walking around, carrying groceries, and touching grass. Basically, anything except sitting or rotting in bed. Lastly, a fat loss tip that everyone thinks doesn’t apply to them is to get good quality sleep. Sleep regulates your hormones. And when it comes to fat loss, these hormones pretty much determine everything.

      "hook_full_transcript": "so you want to become smart in most of the world you're told that it takes 12 years of school plus 4 years of college plus 6 years of graduate school to become smart but what you actually become is homeless that's not even a joke but on the bright side when you make a Reddit post about how you can't get a job you can do it in perfect English if you haven't guessed by the title becoming smart is actually very easy even if you think your genetics make you dumb if you compare yourself to every other animal you're actually pretty over powered when people like you and me say we want to get smarter it means a bunch of things we want to learn useful skills ideally skills that make money we want to be good at solving problems hopefully for money we want to get better geds and learn difficult subjects to make more money and also to flex on people and lastly we want to sound smart in conversation just enough so people respect you but not too much to the point where people think you're a nerd the problem is most advice on the Internet is so vague and philosophical that even if it works the only people who could actually follow it are Oprah and Socrates and if you instead look for specific advice that you can actually try right now this is what you get eat blueberries cuz they brain food drink black coffee exercise sleep more take IQ tests listen to classical music these things sound good but at some point you have to you know actually learn stuff besides even in the past there have been some Geniuses who have spent the whole day sitting at a desk desk getting 2 to 4 hours of sleep a day so what can you actually do to get smarter that's not just the same six brain hacks from a Facebook post copied and pasted from a Wiki how article inspired by a quote spray painted on a New York Subway wall the main thing you need to do is read what kind of reading it depends fiction is good for learning to read faster and it gives you a better vocabulary also if you read a lot of dialogue it makes you feel like you have friends but most people go straight for non-fiction which indeed is the key to being able to casually drop interesting knowledge in conversations for example just by reading this book you can come off to anyone in conversation as someone who knows history the key is to not be obnoxious about it crazy how we evolved from chimpanzees right well actually evolution is nonlinear and several human like species inhabited Earth simultaneously none of which could even be remotely considered as chimpanzees while this is considered polite by the standards of a YouTube comment section in real life saying well actually before proving someone wrong will make you instantly unlikable change the well to an easy and now we're talking let's redo that conversation crazy how we evolved from chimpanzees right it is crazy right you know I was reading the other day and apparently humans and chimpanzees I always thought we evolved from them but I guess we just evolved side by side you can be smart while also being humble and also sounding like you touch grass the key is to teach people what you know without making them sound dumb this way people will actually learn from you which will make them see you as smart and respectable now how do you find these books it's actually really easy you don't have to read the same five books everyone tells you to read just think of a topic you want to learn about like cleaning now Google books about cleaning here's one that looks good usually these books cost money but if your finger slips you might accidentally end up on this website and you might accidentally search for the title of the book and by chance click on the first link and oh no accidentally downloaded a file and opened it with the appropriate ebook viewer well now that you have the book you'll also find that not only can you pick out interesting tidbits to use in conversations but you can also learn many useful skills there are 10 things you should know before you learn a skill one unless you practice the skill your brain will think it's useless and forget it two you only have have to know 20% of the knowledge to master 80% of the skill so I guess we could just move on this is called the learning curve it's a graph of how good you get at a skill over time as you can see just by practicing a little bit you can make a lot of progress in the beginning but you have to practice no one ever learned how to tie a tie by watching how to tie a tie you only learn how to tie a tie by watching how to tie a tie while tying a tie the same applies to reading books only make you smarter if you give your brain a reason to remember the stuff in the book so once you read the chapter on cleaning a bedroom go ahead and clean a bedroom doesn't even have to be your bedroom just clean one and now you'll never forget it but let's just imagine that's something that you can't practice right now like imagine you're reading a book about cars and then you see this diagram of how to jump start a dead car with a good car ideally you'll read about it and then go practice it but not everyone has two cars lying around to practice on but you can still practice it by just imagining imagine the moment where you'll need to know how to jump start a car put yourself in the situation find a video and pretend that's your car by imagining the whole process from start to finish you just convinced your brain that you used all that information and now you'll remember it meanwhile the person who just looked at the diagram and tried to memorize it still won't know what to do if they ever had to jump start a car this is how you get smart use everything you learn and if you can imagine yourself in the moment where it'll be useful this is basically how the entire school system works you learn a piece of information and because it'll be like 15 years before you actually use it your teacher creates an imaginary situation where that information is useful that is a test an exam that has questions on that exact piece of information and if you get it wrong you fail or in South Korea you get prison time just kidding that's only if you cheat this is usually in enough to make your brain at least attempt to remember the information the only problem is once the test is over your brain says it's not useful anymore and you forget it some people think repetition or space repetition or studying in intervals or mind mapping will help them get better grades and learn faster but in reality doing practice questions will give you the most results because they simulate the actual situation in which you'll need to use what you learned if you don't have any practice questions make your own and convince yourself that the stakes are high like pretend that you're hanging off a cliff by one arm and someone's there to pull you up but only if you can name all the parts of a human cell learning information and making it seem useful to your brain is all you need to get smart and this is why textbooks are the S tier format for becoming smart as fast as possible there's no fluff no handholding no distractions just pure information and a bunch of practice questions and if you can't solve them you have to flip all the way to page XXX VV I II in the appendix to get help textbooks aren't for the Casual learner because it's not as fun as watching a YouTube video on the topic and forgetting it all an hour later but if you're ever up to the challenge there is a website you might accidentally end up on where you could accidentally download free textbooks on any subject you want but before you do that I'm collecting donations in the form of subscribes to fund the next video [Music]"

      "hook_full_transcript": "[Music] the more you open your life up for display the more people find a way to drag you down it's a natural sociological phenomenon there's something powerful about disappearing and working in the shadows becoming unavailable and committing to become the next version of you in secret can be exhilarating exciting because you know that when you reappear your transformation will Shock the World funny thing is when you do you won't care because you'll learn in the shadows that the only opinion that matters is yours let's get into how to do this the right way I'm going to break it down to the three key parts of this for you first is how to disappear second is what to do in the shadows and third is how to reappear and if you mess up any part of this especially the last you're going to regret it let's get it now how how do we disappear the right way number one shut your mouth your mouth betrays you much more than you know you need to get it under control you will no longer speak openly about your life to anyone else this includes your family your friends your co-workers no one the only exception is your life partner and that's if you know that they want you to succeed and crush it all I really hope that the answer is a yes yes you will have trouble controlling your mouth it's going to take time the natural habit we have is to just spill information it's coded into us for the survival of the species we need to fight that to really disappear properly you will need to learn to catch thoughts before they leave your mouth become a mystery to everyone and then you will be able to move in the shadows number two only care what you think everyone doesn't matter anymore to disappear and stay hidden you will have to reprogram your mind you'll have to not care what others think first of all they don't care about you but the problem is you think that they care about you and that dictates a lot of your actions you need to kill that side of you that cares what others think what you have to do is create a person in your mind that person is you and you have to obset about what that person thinks about you and that's the only person that matters would you be proud of you would you be happy about what you did we're so driven from what others think you have to cheat and make you the other person through this process you will be less a puppet of others and More in control of your own life this is not an easy task and it takes practice and repetition share in the comments if you've been able to figure this trick out out and explain how number three hide your plans you'll develop some ambitious plans in this journey you'll get excited you'll want to share your plans with those around you don't you dare keep those plans close to your chest like they are the passwords to your treasure a healthy way to think about it is to imagine that every part of your plan that leaks out reduces your chances of accomplishing those plans by five % every time you speak about your plans and show them openly to people you are hurting yourself you are satisfying others and hurting yourself stop being so careless and be surgically intentional if you need to get advice or benefit from someone's expertise to Aid in your planning then do so with precision and focused intent find the exact right person reveal only the bare minimum and obtain the knowledge you need and disappear again number four hide your progress progress will come it may take some time but it will arrive and you'll notice that progress is more easily had when you disappear but don't let anyone see it don't show off your improved physique don't show off your improved wealth don't show off your new skills just focus on progressing even more disappearing is only worth it if it gets you through the entire transformation going back to your old ways mid transformation will probably reverse all of the progress you've made and you'll be back at square one you will feel the natural urge to share about the changes you are seeing in your life you will have to flex your willpower and keep things boxed in use that energy to pour more fuel into your efforts recycling that energy help get you to the next level in your journey and we are all about life level UPS on this channel so like And subscribe to stay included in the discovery and discussion number five hide your tears blood failures going ghost mode or monk mode or whatever basically crushing it in the shadows is going to be tough you are going to be physically hurt be mentally fatigued and you may bleed or cry after facing filter after filter that stand between you and progress what would be your instinct at each wall maybe go complain about it to a close friend or go receive some words of comfort from your family yeah you guessed it you'll need to shut the metaphorical pie hole and bleed sweat and cry all by your lonesome scream into the wind let those tears flow from your face patch up your wounds with a first aid kit but do it yourself do it in the shadows and let it build your strength and character Let each moment of Rock Bottom be the moment of catapulting you to another level of performance it's those moments of pain that a new you emerges Embrace that pain and go as far as looking forward to it true beast mode and now we're ready to transform number one pick your targets what are you going to transform it's simple to become something through this process you need to know what that something is be specific about this what is it that you want to build want to be absolutely jacked and unrecognizable want to have a money printing business whatever it is be very clear on what you want to accomplish write it down put it up in places that you can see it but remember no one else can see it number two revolve your life around crushing it every waking hour should be planned to drive towards your goals be obsessed you will need the mentality that this is your one chance in life dedicate your every breath to it everything that you do should be intentional and should be to Aid you in crushing it move to an apartment that is close to the gym or exercise class that works well for your goals join a class that teaches you the skills needed to accomplish your goals time box your day so that you are spending at least a few hours on working on your transformation each day dedicate a day to looking at your plan updating it tracking your progress towards your goals and breaking down the larger goals into smaller manageable goals do all that it takes number three reprogram your mind happiness is crushing it you're going to have to love this disappearing act you will have to love crushing it in the shadows you will feel everything is quite strange at the beginning but eventually you will find yourself enjoying the pain and not being seen this is going to include a shift in your thinking a reprogramming of your mind it is something that will be a part of your positive transformation so embrace it and help the change occur after you've accomplished your transformation you can reappear but actually something very interesting will have happened along the way this reappearing back into society is something you won't need anymore if you do this right you won't care to reappear you'll have now become one with the shadow your life will have transformed form Med beyond your expectations you will always keep crushing it and will keep pushing towards bigger goals better goals and you will remain a mystery to most and you'll find that you found a calming peace in the shadows and that you found a new life that you enjoy far greater than what you had before and if you'd like to learn about an incredible cheat code in life check out

      "hook_full_transcript": "your enemy approaches once again your most dangerous and worthwhile foe it has stopped you from accomplishing your goals from you proving everyone wrong from you living your best life this enemy is you and you lose because you lack discipline this channel is your dojo this video is your training all you need to do is commit we first are going to touch on what we need to know about our enemy you then we're going to reveal how you gain disciplin the right way once and for all the general sunzo said know your enemy and know yourself then out of 100 Battles you will win 100 here are the five things to know about your inner enemy and why it stops you from achieving from progressing and why you need to take discipline seriously with a bonus tip at the end number one coded for Comfort we are coded in a certain way that keeps us from venturing into the unknown whenever we want to change ourselves grow ourselves there is inner programming that wants to keep us in our usual routine this is because we are coded to work for the survival of our species keeping us within our comfort zones as long as we are fed our are warm safe can reproduce that's good enough for the species avoiding risks is also a part of our coding we gravitate towards the safe known route in our survival coding taking risks could mean death it can mean the end of a bloodline therefore our minds will try to keep us from veering off the known path it will keep us into a known routine your human system does not know of all of the good waiting for you out there as long as you work towards it so it maintains course and if you try to stretch and reach for something better it starts to send you doubts negative thoughts and visions of danger it's trying to protect you your enemy thinks that it is your friend unfortunately it's keeping you from a better life so you have to be selective on what you listen to number two fear of success what if things do change what if you do grow and your opport OPP unities grow and your life is no longer what you are used to your mind is also afraid of what could come when you achieve your goals this is tied in with your system defaulting to comfort however this point reveals that even if your mind knew that you could accomplish your goal and achieve it may still try to keep you from progressing because it's afraid of your success weird how the human system works but it's incredibly powerful to know your own Tendencies to know know your enemy Within number three low self-esteem you may not believe in yourself and that's a damn shame but a lot of us have low self-esteem where did this come from probably not having the best support system growing up maybe it was a negative voice during our formative years something happened or is happening to limit your own belief in yourself whatever reason there is your mind may just stop your attempts for grow grow by leveraging your low self-esteem and sending you doubts what makes you think you can do that it's silly to think you can achieve these things stop being a child and grow up and stick to what you know man that's a bunch of nonsense so many of us are victims of these self-limiting beliefs it's going to take work to fix that programming in you just commit and we'll get it done trust me you're a fool if you believe everything your mind throw at you number four cheap fixes the unconditioned mind will search for cheap rewards over long-term gains it will weigh decisions based on how much immediate pleasure can be obtained if anything involves pain in the short term it'll run away lifting those weights seems like it's going to hurt let's Sound the Alarm Bell so we can run away from the gym figuring out a business seems like a whole lot of late nights and complex problems let's keep watching YouTube videos about starting a business that's much much more comfortable eating that salad and chicken breast is pretty bland but that cinnamon bun and Coke just give my taste buds a kick so let's worry about health stuff later you're a prisoner of immediate Pleasures if you never grow your long-term muscle discipline will solve this number five overwhelm when you establish ambitious goals your mind will try to grasp it all at once when it seems like it's too much your mind collapses under the weight of what you are trying to achieve and stops you from taking even the first step your mind likes to exaggerate things it's also a survival mechanism it will take a tiny problem and blow it out of proportion leave it up to your inner enemy to make a mountain out of a mole hill the right approach to discipline helps to avoid these situations by never letting a goal be too big on its own more on that next and a clarification about your inner enemy we touched on this that your inner enemy is just your inner programming that is trying to protect you so be careful to not take this to the extreme we are calling it your enemy because it's true that most of the time you are the one holding yourself back your inner voices are the most effective at stopping your advance and your growth so don't hate yourself like yourself so much that you are willing to study yourself and learn how to effectively deal with your own programming share in the comments if this this make sense and share your own story about battling your inner enemy I think that'll help clarify what this means and now that you know your enemy it's time to harness discipline the right way so you can survive your own limiting thoughts and finally make consistent progress towards getting things done here are the seven most critical and effective steps to obtain true discipline in your life with the last one being an advanced one to unlock Unstoppable discipline number one yes goals we pound the table on this point over and over and over again I'm not kidding here do not half ass this part this is the foundation of everything you are building spend an entire day on clarifying what your goals are you need to know where you are going to apply any discipline to get there right it's pretty straightforward there are several videos in this channel that speak to this and there will be more so like this video And subscribe to the channel so you stay a part of the journey as a bonus tip on goals it's good to have goals that touch on all critical parts of your life have a specific goal on health have a specific goal on wealth have one on your purpose in life have one on family and relationships and always come back to your goals if you have more to add along the way number two break the goals down now take those goals and break them down into smaller goals remember what we talked about if you leave goals too big and lofty your mind just doesn't know how to handle itself so avoid that mess by taking big big goals and making them smaller and smaller and smaller create Milestones that are achievable if you want to be in the best shape of your life that goal by itself is hard to figure out so break it down you want to have body fat percent below 133% you want to have 10 more pounds of muscle mass you want to be able to bench press 250 lb comfortably you want to run a marathon okay that's a good breakdown but you don't have to stop there you can keep breaking them down until they are measurable distinct and feel achievable number three create routines and daily habits now this is where you start figuring out how you inch forward the trick with discipline is to make things very micro make the habits that you plant into your day today very doable and as mindless as possible the more your mind comes into the picture the more opportunities you are giving your enemy remove the Mind from the picture and you disarm your inner thoughts automate things as much as possible make things as easy as possible here's an example my health goal is to work out for 1 hour consistently each day and to gain 20 lbs of muscle I always try to live near a fitness class that helps me build my strength the reason I hinge my life around this Fitness class is because it allows me to be mindless about working out all I have to do is go into the class then the program and instructors take care of everything all I have to do is do what they say or what is shown on the screen I've isolated the challenge to be just being there on time but once I get into the door I must obey them for one hour and I leave there a few inches towards my goal you can do this with your financial goals too automate your investing sending a set amount of money to your savings account or stock brokerage each month and doing this first then spending what you have left forcing you to work around your investing and not your investing to work around you there are always certain habits that will get you to your goals planting these habits makes it so you are exercising discipline mindlessly and this is the best type of discipline because you are minimizing the battle with yourself don't get a bigger weapon make the opponent smaller number four remove Temptations anything that could derail you or serve as fuel for your self-sabotaging thoughts you need to remove from your environment and your life if you have existing habits or temptations that usually pull you away from working towards your goals with discipline just get rid of them you need to be ruthless about this your mind will try try to rationalize the existence of these Temptation alcohol sugars and sweets sodas social media clutter gambling just name a few get rid of them if you're going into battle with your inner demons why leave these landmines scattered all throughout the Battleground why set yourself up for failure take this seriously this is your life and no one is going to grab your best life for you other than yourself and your habits number five prioritize self-care to be determined and exercise discipline you do need energy to win these micro battles with your own self-defeating thoughts you need to have enough sleep enough water enough nutrition enough sunlight the chemical cocktail that is you needs to be in balance with the right things for you to be in battle ready condition don't think that discipline and chasing your goals is at the sacrifice of your own body and health that's foolish you need to take care of yourself even more so if you want to be disciplined in the right way number six move in the shadows I have a whole series of videos on this topic and it's very relevant here if you want to battle your limiting beliefs and win it's best you Embrace disappearing and transforming in the shadows if you broadcast everyone about your goals and blabber about your progress to anyone you're your mind will have more fuel to bring you down being disciplined will come with it bearing weight along the journey you will have to keep walking as these chains try to keep you from advancing the more you are visible to others about your plans and the more you broadcast them the more chains you will feel on you your journey will be heavier I do state in the disappear series of videos that there is the exception of a very special life partner or friend that could help you on this journey but generally if you want to develop strong discipline it's best you build the kind that you can handle alone just plan on disappearing and you will be unstoppable and check out the videos on disappearing in this channel if you haven't this tip will make more sense number seven embrace the pain reprogram your mind this is the ultimate tip on discipline discipline can be hard because you are fighting through the pain and struggle of growth your mind is sending you warning thoughts and doubts to keep you from advancing but once you follow the above tips and shape the Battleground so your discipline is more effective you can practice an advanced method of discipline this is to flip your programming on its head you can train yourself to like the pain of growth to yearn for the struggle this takes some concerted focus in lots of Cycles but for example exercising each day can be hard because of the pain of working out but once you train your mind you can get to a place where you look forward to the sweat and the struggle not the end of the workout but the middle of the workout where your legs are screaming and your arms are screaming but you smile and say that you wouldn't want to be anywhere else but in this moment of pain what comes with this is a form of Enlightenment it's when you realize that peace and happiness in life comes from the journey not the destination that the struggle is where the beauty lies and this requires deeper conversations to fully reveal which we will have I promise but just know that it's doable to embrace the pain and then your inner enemy is harmless and your discipline Unstoppable and if you'd like to get some additional tips on powerful daily habits check out this video here"

There are shapes around the duck too. You can trace to start off with, but practice this from observation to get even better. Basic shapes are the starting point you build upon. But how many shapes do you really need to represent a duck? What about 3D? Well, draw a square. Draw another square. Connect the corners. You have a 3D shape. Draw a triangle. Draw another triangle. Connect the corners. 3D shape. Draw lots of these 3D shapes. Remember the circle. Squash the circle to create an ellipse or a squashed circle. Draw lots of squashed circles. Draw one squashed circle and another squashed circle and connect the corners. Hey, look, a tube or a cylinder. Draw lots of tubes. If you draw curved lines on the tube, notice the direction of the curve dictates the direction of the tube. Practice that. You can use spirals to practice that too. Let me put this into perspective for you. Draw a horizon line. Mark a vanishing point in the middle and draw lines coming out of the vanishing point. Nice onepoint perspective grid. On your grid, draw a square. Draw lines from the corners following the guide and connecting them with a straight vertical line. Nice 3D shape in onepoint perspective. Notice how shapes drawn above the horizon line show their bottom face and shapes drawn below the horizon line show their top face. Shapes drawn both above and below the horizon line show neither face. Cool perspective. Notice how shapes drawn on the right of the center line show their left face and shapes drawn on the left of the center line show their right face. You can construct other shapes out of squares by drawing on their faces or draw them directly after practice. The better you get, the less you will need to rely on the guide. This onepoint perspective is good for indoor scenes. Let's get crazy with twopoint perspective. Draw a horizon line. Mark two vanishing points at either end and draw lines coming out of each vanishing point. Two point perspective grid. Draw two vertical lines and connect them following the guide. Draw more lines following the guide towards the other vanishing point and connect them with a vertical line. Now you have a 3D shape in twopoint perspective. Again, noticing how the shapes appear above and below the horizon line. Don't be afraid to sketch it out and clean it up. It doesn't have to be precise. You can construct other shapes out of squares just like before. What happens when the vanishing points are super close together? You get this weird warped perspective, right? Usually the vanishing points are far off screen. Now practice combining shapes together, constructing whole scenes. 2D perspective is very good for outdoor scenes. Welcome back to our duck. Now that we know basic shapes, 3D shapes, onepoint and twopoint perspective, we can draw our duck in 3D perspective. Let's break it down into basic shapes. Again, notice how this all fits within a square. We'll use this. Pay attention to the relationship between the shapes and the negative space. Using this as a guide, we can also draw the front view of the duck. Now, using a twopoint perspective grid, draw the side square view following the perspective and build up the duck's shapes. Remember when I said to pay attention to the relationship between the shapes and negative space? Yeah, keep doing that. Now, you can draw in the front view as thick as you like. How thick is your duck? Now, we have a 3D constructed duck in perspective. You can use this as a base to build upon, smooth out, and fix areas if you want. Keep practicing this and you won't even need the guide anymore. Cool, right? But what about organic shapes? Well, organic shapes are just block shapes smoothed out. You can imagine the faces of a basic 3D shape, being able to dissect them to create even more faces, extruding, pushing, pulling to create more complex shapes. There are endless amounts of faces. You can imagine it as a wireframe. See if you can draw 3D shapes with wireframes. Create some organic shapes. They may look complicated, but remember they can be simplified into more basic shapes because everything is just shapes. Hands, they're just shapes. Anatomy. Again, it's just shapes. A muscular duck flexing and popping a kickflip while wearing a backwards hat. Shapes. Keep drawing shapes. And with practice, you too can draw whatever you"

      "hook_full_transcript": "most people are learning skills the wrong way stuck in a loop of endless tutorials outdated advice and giving up just before a breakthrough but you don't have to meet most people by tapping into how your brain actually learns and using science-backed methods you can Master any skill at lightning speed forget slow forget average in this video we're breaking down the best methods you need to learn anything as fast as humanly possible let's dive in if you've ever tried to learn something new you've probably done the classic sit watch and hope it sticks routine you watch tutorials read books b or listen to podcasts thinking yeah I totally get this but then when it's time to actually do it you freeze your brain draws a blank you realize you still don't know what to do why the problem is simple passive learning feels productive but it's an illusion think about the last time you learned something difficult did it happen when you were re-watching the same tutorial for the 10th time probably not it happened when you were forced to figure something out yourself this is because of a concept called desirable difficulty when learning feels too easy your brain doesn't actually grow but when learning feels hard when you're forced to think struggle and make mistakes that's when real growth happens it's uncomfortable it's intense but it's also 10 times faster than passive learning here's a fact that sounds too simple to be true you learn faster by testing yourself than by reviewing information this is called active recall when you're forced to recall something from memory instead of passively reviewing it your brain works 10 times harder locking in that knowledge like a mental save file and research proves it in one study students who studied by reviewing notes performed worse than students who studied by by taking self tests self testing triggers a memory retrieval process in your brain which tells your brain this information is important don't forget it so how do you apply this stop rereading notes or re-watching lessons instead test yourself constantly if you're learning guitar after learning a chord look away from the chart and see if you can play it from memory if you're studying for an exam quiz yourself or try to remember what you just read instead of rereading the textbook because if you're not being tested you're not really learning most people think learning means collecting information but all of that knowledge is useless until it's applied in the real world because the goal isn't to know everything before you start the goal is to start right away use that knowledge in practice and fill in the gaps as you go this way you only learn what you need right before you need it you don't have to memorize every chess strategy to start playing chess you learn one strategy try it out fail then adjust this approach speeds up learning because you're not wasting time on unnecessary theory that is destined to be forgotten anyway number two if you've ever found yourself grinding away at a new SK you've probably experienced the frustration of not knowing what to do next the task feels endless no matter how many hours you pour into it your skill level is hard stuck and despite staying consistent you just cannot improve and the worst part is you don't know why that's where feedback loops come in feedback loops are the steering wheel without them you can be as consistent as you want but if you're heading in the wrong direction all that effort means nothing feedback loops are how you know what's working what's not and what to do next so if you want to become better really fast you must understand how feedback loops work a feedback loop is a cycle of action result analysis adjustment if you've ever played a video game you've seen this in action you press a button this is action your character jumps as a result and you decide that was too slow so you press it earlier next time and that's adjustment feedback loops come in two main flavors first we have positive feedback loops these reinforce Behavior if you see success you're more likely to keep doing the same thing think about hitting a bullseye in archery you immediately feel a jolt of satisfaction and your brain locks in on whatever I just did I should do more of that then there's negative feedback loops these correct mistakes if you mess up you get an alert and realize okay that wasn't it it's not punishment it's information the more you engage with this type of feedback the faster you adapt this matters because without feedback you're Flying Blind you have no idea if what you're doing is effective you might even be reinforcing bad habits the biggest and most common mistake Learners make when learning a new skill is avoiding feedback why because it's uncomfortable we'd rather not know that our singing is off key or that our essays are riddled with mistakes but here's the truth avoiding feedback is the number one reason people stay bad at things when people say I've been doing this for years but I'm still not good it's often because they've been avoiding feedback no coach no review just doing the same thing incorrectly over and over like someone practicing guitar for hours but strumming every cord wrong it's the classic 10,000 hour misconception people think that if they just put in more hours they'll get better but if you're practicing the wrong technique for 10,000 hours all you've done is Master The Art of Doing It Wrong and here's a secret the faster you get feedback the faster you learn if you only get feedback after a week your brain has already forgotten what action caused the result but if feedback comes instantly like in video games you adjust much faster this is why people learn faster with video games than textbooks now not all feedback is useful some is too vague like just do better next time or keep going you're doing great to learn faster you need your feedback to be clear actionable and on time the best feedback tells you what to do not how to feel you don't need someone yelling at you for missing a shot you need information on how to improve good feedback sounds something like your foot placement is off by 2 in which is making you lose balance or try pressing the button half a second earlier all right so you know feedback is critical but how do you actually create it in your own learning process here are some methods number one self-correction record yourself doing the skill and watch it back you'll instantly spot mistakes number two external feedback get someone experience to watch you and give specific advice coaches are human feedback machines number three deliberate practice focus on one thing at a time and try to do it correctly until you get it right this creates a mini feedback loop with every attempt now while these methods are incredibly effective having the right tools and resources can make learning even faster and more

wondered why some people seem to master new skills ridiculously fast While others stay stuck for months here's the secret they don't try to learn everything most people think that more information equals faster progress so they watch more tutorials read more books and follow every complete guide they can find but this creates what's called information overload you're exposed to so much information that your brain can't tell what's important and what's fluff an economist called vredo pero noticed that 80% of Italy's land was owned by 20% of the people later people realized that this 8020 split shows up everywhere this is the 8020 Rule and it says that 80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts it's the reason why 20% of language vocabulary allows you to understand 80% of conversation 20% of musical practice Tech techniques lead to 80% of improvement in performance 20% of coding skills solve 80% of programming problems this principle is everywhere and when it comes to learning skills fast it's a GameChanger While most people waste time on fluff and nice to know knowledge the at20 master focuses on only the critical few things that actually matter the key idea here is that if 80% of results come from 20% of the effort stop doing the 80% of things that don't matter to master skills quickly you need to one find the 20% of key actions Concepts or techniques that deliver the biggest impact two double down on them three ignore everything else at least for now number four so if you wanted to climb Mount Everest would you rather go with a group of beginners who've never seen snow or would you stick with a crew of seasoned Mountaineers seems obvious right the same logic applies to learning any skill at lightning speed you level up faster when you surround yourself with experts experts aren't just people who know more than you they're walking talking cheap codes they shorten the learning curve expose you to methods you'd never think of on your own and most importantly they show you what you're doing wrong which is way more important than knowing what you're doing right the first thing experts do is expose your blind spots when you're learning a new skill you're basically feeling around in the dark you have no idea if you're making the right moves and that's a problem you could spend years repeating the same mistake all because you didn't know it was a mistake this is called a blind spot something you're doing wrong but can't see for yourself no amount of self-reflection will reveal it experts however see your blind spots instantly they've been where you are and they know where you're going wrong before you do it's like a chess grandmas watching a beginner they can see free moves ahead while the beginner is focused on what's directly in front of them imagine you're learning to play guitar you practice for months but you're playing sounds off you have no clue why then a professional guitarist watches you play for 30 seconds and says oh your fingers are too flat on the Frets tilt them at this angle that one tweak instant Improvement you'd never have figured it out alone if you're learning on your own you're stuck in guesswork mode you try a method fail try another fail again and repeat this works eventually but it's slow experts skip this step for you they've already made those mistakes and they know the exact path you need to follow instead of guessing and repeating you're following a proven road map when you're surrounded by experts you're constantly exposed to their language terms metaphors and mental models you wouldn't hear from beginners you're also exposed to their mindset solving problems the way they would and you're exposed to their standards experts have high standards and when you're around them you start to hold yourself to those standards too experts also create pressure the right kind of pressure if you're surrounded by people who are way better than you you might feel a little out of place it's uncomfortable but that discomfort is actually one of the most powerful forces for growth that's because you feel the need to keep up with them this forces you to push harder than you would if you were just practicing alone this positive pressure is a powerful motivator your brain doesn't want to be the weakest link in the tribe so it forces you to rise to the occasion"
