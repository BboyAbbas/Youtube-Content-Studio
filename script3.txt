You're not scared of failure. You're scared of looking stupid.

So you plan. You research. You wait until you're "ready."

Here's the truth: clarity comes after you start. Not before.

Your first attempt is supposed to suck. That's not failure. That's the process.

Stop preparing. Start ugly. Start now.
