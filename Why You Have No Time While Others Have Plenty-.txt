Some people have endless time. They work out. They read. They build businesses. They have hobbies. Meanwhile you can barely finish your to-do list. Same 24 hours. Completely different results. Seems unfair. It's not.

You're just giving your time away. Like an idiot.

"I'm so busy." No you're not. "I need more hours." No you don't. Successful people aren't getting bonus time. They don't have a secret 25th hour. They just stopped handing their hours to things that don't matter. You haven't.

But here's something weird. Medieval peasants worked less than you. Seriously. Historians checked. Peasants. Farming by hand. No electricity. No machines. More free time than modern humans with dishwashers and cars and computers.

How? They didn't have companies stealing their attention. I'll show you exactly how to fight back in a minute, but first you need to see how bad this really is.

See, there's a war happening. For your time. Big companies hire neuroscientists. Psychologists. Addiction experts. Their job? Make you scroll longer. Watch more. Click again. They get paid millions to steal minutes from your life. And they're winning. You don't even know you're fighting.

Medieval peasants had no war. Just work, then done. You? You're under attack 24/7. And losing.

Let me tell you a story. Guy complains to friend. "I don't have time." Friend asks how many hours on phone yesterday. Guy says one hour. Checks screen time. Five hours. Five. Hours. Scrolling. Watching nothing.

He wasn't busy. He was captured. By apps designed to capture him. Idiot didn't even notice.

Here's the truth nobody wants. You don't find time. You don't have time. You make time. How? By choosing what not to do. By fighting back.

Most people treat time like weather. "I don't have time" like "It's raining." Something happening to them. Wrong. Garbage mindset. The apps want you thinking this way. Makes you easier to capture.

Here's what works. Track everything for one week. Everything. Eating. Working. Scrolling. Staring at ceiling.

Then look at the list. You'll want to cry. Hours on stuff that doesn't matter. Hours scrolling in bed. Hours watching shows you don't even like. Hours refreshing social media like something life-changing will appear. Be honest—when's the last time scrolling actually changed your life?

It won't. The neuroscientists made sure of that. They designed it to never satisfy you. So you keep scrolling. Forever. Until you die. Dramatic but true.

New rule. Treat time like money. Someone asks for money? You think about it. But time? You give it to apps designed by addiction experts. Would you hand cash to a casino? Then why hand time to Instagram?

Ask yourself one question. Is this worth my life? Because that's what time is. Your life. Every hour is a piece of your existence. Gone forever. Given to some company's quarterly earnings report.

Medieval peasants gave time to survival. You give time to shareholders. Who's the real peasant here?

So flip it. Put important stuff first. Schedule your actual goals. Like meetings you can't miss. Everything else fits around that. Or it doesn't happen.

Cut the garbage. Stop watching shows just because algorithms suggested them. Say no to notifications. Suddenly you have time.

But here's the thing. You can reclaim all the time you want, but if you're slow at learning the skills you actually need, what's the point? Most people get their time back then waste it learning things the hard way. Idiots. That's why I made this video breaking down exactly how to learn anything so fast it feels like cheating.
